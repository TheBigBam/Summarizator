Agriculture (USDA) are responsible for ensuring the safety of virtually all domestic and imported food products. FDA and USDA cooperate with states, tribes, and local food safety and public health agencies to carry out their federal responsibilities. FDA and USDA undertake a risk-based approach, in which inspection rates vary depending on the degree to which the agencies inspect facilities. This report examines (1) the extent to which FDA and USDA have assessed the safety of food products, (2) the extent to which FDA and USDA have designed a risk-based inspection approach: and the extent of actions taken to improve oversight of food safety; and actions taken to improve oversight of food safety; and actions taken to improve oversight of food safety; and actions taken to improve oversight; and oversight; and results; and challenges; and (3) FDA and factors that FDA and factors that FDA and USDA has taken to address risks to improve oversight of food safety; and actions taken to improve oversight of food safety; and actions taken to improve oversight of food safety; and actions taken to improve oversight of food safety; and USDA actions to improve oversight of food safety; and whether they are consistent with relevant controls.

  0  Multiple firms have produced cell-cultured meat as part of their research and development. These products appear likely to become available to consumers in coming years. FDA and USDA are the primary agencies responsible for overseeing the safety of the nation's food supply. However, some stakeholders have expressed concern about the agencies' oversight of cell-cultured meat amidst a fragmented federal food safety oversight system. GAO was asked to review federal oversight of cell-cultured meat. This report (1) describes what is known about methods for commercially producing cell-cultured meat, and (2) examines the extent to which FDA and USDA are collaborating to provide regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat. GAO conducted a literature review; reviewed documentation from FDA, USDA, and stakeholder groups; analyzed public comments submitted to the agencies; compared agency efforts with leading practices for interagency collaboration; and conducted site visits to selected cell-cultured meat firms. General information about the process of making cell-cultured meat—food products grown from the cells of livestock, poultry, and seafood—is available. However, no company is commercially producing cell-cultured meat. Specific information about the technology being used, eventual commercial production methods, and composition of the final products is not yet known. The general process contains five phases: biopsy, cell banking, growth, harvest, and food processing (see figure). The technology and methods to be used for commercial production are still in development, and producers, regulators, and consumers do not have clarity about many specifics about the process and final product. For example, it is unclear whether production methods and products will use or contain genetically-engineered cells or medications such as antibiotics. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have begun collaborating on regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat. For example, in 2019, the agencies signed an interagency agreement and created three working groups to carry out the terms of the agreement. However, the agreement and working groups could more fully incorporate practices to enhance and sustain collaboration, such as defining outcomes. For example, the agreement identifies the development of labeling principles as an outcome, but does not describe how the agencies will track and monitor progress toward this outcome, and the working groups identify a lead agency but not members' roles. Also, agency officials said they decided FDA would oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish, but they have not formally announced or documented this decision. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements is also a leading practice for interagency collaboration. By fully incorporating leading practices into their efforts to collaborate, the agencies could minimize potential overlap and fragmentation, use resources in a more efficient manner, and better ensure the public and other key stakeholders have clarity about the agencies' oversight responsibilities. GAO recommends that FDA and USDA more fully incorporate leading practices for effective collaboration in the agencies' interagency agreement. FDA and USDA partially concurred and indicated a willingness to incorporate these practices in a more detailed agreement, which would also meet the intent of the recommendations. The agencies concurred with the four other recommendations.\n","   1  Federal advisory committees provide advice to federal agencies on many topics. As of March 31, 2018, EPA managed 22 such committees. They advise the agency on such issues as developing regulations and managing research programs. Questions have been raised about EPA's process for appointing committee members after recent policy changes affecting who serves on the advisory committees. GAO was asked to review issues related to how EPA appoints advisory committee members. This report examines: (1) EPA's process for appointing advisory committee members, (2) the extent to which EPA followed its process for selecting members from October 2016 through March 2018, and (3) how, if at all, selected characteristics of EPA advisory committees changed after January 2017. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; reviewed documents from committees that appointed members over this period; analyzed information from the GSA's FACA database; and interviewed agency officials. Based on GAO's review of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) guidance, the agency's established process for appointing advisory committee members involves three main phases: soliciting nominations, evaluating candidates, and obtaining approvals. Each phase involves several steps. For example, a key step for evaluating candidates involves EPA staff's preparing documents that reflect staff recommendations on the best qualified and most appropriate candidates for achieving balanced committee membership, according to EPA guidance. EPA generally followed its established process for most of its 22 advisory committees; however, in fiscal year 2018, EPA did not follow a key step for appointing 20 committee members to two committees GAO reviewed: the EPA Science Advisory Board and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, which advise the agency on environmental regulatory matters, among other things. The 2018 appointment packets for these two committees did not contain documents reflecting EPA staff rationales for proposed membership, as called for by EPA's established process. EPA developed guidance to implement the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). By directing officials responsible for appointing committee members to follow a key step in its process to document staff rationales for proposed membership, the agency would have better assurance that it will (1) consistently meet FACA's purpose of encouraging uniform appointment procedures and (2) show how it made appointment decisions to achieve the best qualified and most appropriate candidates for balanced committee membership. EPA also did not consistently ensure that members appointed as special government employees (SGE)—who are expected to provide their best judgment free from conflicts of interest and are required by federal regulations to disclose their financial interests—met federal ethics requirements. For about 23 percent, or 17 of the 74 financial disclosure forms GAO reviewed, an ethics official had not signed and dated that the SGE filing the form was in compliance with federal ethics rules. EPA also did not periodically review its ethics program, as called for by federal regulations, such as through audits or spot-checks, to evaluate the quality of financial disclosure reviews for SGEs. Until EPA's Ethics Office evaluates the quality of financial disclosure reviews of SGEs as part of its periodic review of its ethics program, it will not have reasonable assurance that it will address noncompliance with federal ethics requirements and prevent conflicts of interest on its advisory committees. Based on GAO's review of the U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) FACA database, there were notable changes to selected characteristics of EPA advisory committees (i.e. at least a 20 percentage point difference in the change to a characteristic after January 2017 compared to the period after January 2009). Of the four characteristics GAO reviewed—committee composition, regional affiliation, membership turnover, and number of meetings committees held—one or more of the first three changed notably for four of 18 EPA advisory committees after January 2017. GAO is recommending that EPA direct (1) officials responsible for appointing committee members to follow a key step in its appointment process to document staff rationales for proposed membership and (2) EPA's Ethics Office to evaluate the quality of financial disclosure reviews of SGEs appointed to advisory committees. EPA disagreed with the first and agreed with the second recommendation. GAO continues to believe that both are valid, as discussed in the report.\n","   2  DOD manages a global real-estate portfolio with an almost $1.2 trillion estimated replacement value. Since 2010, DOD has identified climate change as a threat to its operations and installations. In January 2019, DOD stated that the effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to the department's missions, operational plans, and installations. GAO was asked to assess DOD's progress in developing a means to account for potentially damaging weather in its facilities project designs. GAO examined the extent to which DOD has taken steps to incorporate resilience to extreme weather and climate change effects into (1) selected installation master plans and related planning documents, and (2) selected individual installation facilities projects. GAO reviewed DOD documents related to increasing climate resilience, conducting installation master planning, and designing facilities projects. GAO visited or contacted a non-generalizable sample of 23 installations that had been associated with one or more climate vulnerabilities. Department of Defense (DOD) installations have not consistently assessed risks from extreme weather and climate change effects or consistently used projections to anticipate future climate conditions. For example, DOD's 2018 preliminary assessment of extreme weather and climate effects at installations was based on the installations' reported past experiences with extreme weather rather than an analysis of future vulnerabilities based on climate projections. Fifteen of the 23 installations GAO visited or contacted had considered some extreme weather and climate change effects in their plans as required by DOD guidance, but 8 had not. For example, Fort Irwin, California, worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to improve stormwater drainage after intense flash flooding caused significant damage to base infrastructure. By contrast, Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, did not include such considerations in its plans, although it is located in an area subject to tropical storms and where further sea level rise is anticipated. GAO also found that most of the installations had not used climate projections, because they lack guidance on how to incorporate projections into their master plans. Not assessing risks or using climate projections in installation planning may expose DOD facilities to greater-than-anticipated damage or degradation as a result of extreme weather or climate-related effects. Eleven of the 23 installations we reviewed had designed one or more individual facilities projects to increase the resilience of the facilities to extreme weather and climate change effects. However, project designs generally did not consider climate projections, according to installation officials. These officials told us that DOD lacks guidance on how to use climate projections that involve multiple future scenarios and different time periods. Until DOD updates its facilities design standards to require installations to consider climate projections in project designs, identify authoritative sources for them to use, and provide guidance on how to use projections, installation project designers may continue to exclude consideration of climate projections from facilities project designs, potentially making investments that are planned without consideration of climate-related risks. GAO is making eight recommendations, including that the military departments work together to update master planning criteria to require an assessment of extreme weather and climate change risks and to incorporate DOD guidance on the use of climate projections into facilities design standards. GAO also recommends that DOD issue guidance on incorporating climate projections into installation master planning and facilities project designs. DOD concurred with all eight of GAO's recommendations.\n","   3  Nursing homes provide care to about 1.4 million nursing home residents—a vulnerable population of elderly and disabled individuals. CMS, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), defines standards nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. GAO was asked to review abuse of residents in nursing homes. Among other objectives, this report: (1) determines the trends and types of abuse in recent years, and (2) evaluates CMS oversight intended to ensure residents are free from abuse. GAO reviewed CMS's policies, analyzed CMS data on abuse deficiencies from 2013 through 2017, the most recent data at the time of our review, and interviewed officials from CMS and state survey agencies in five states, as well as other key stakeholders in those states such as ombudsmen and law enforcement officials. The states were selected for variation in factors such as number of nursing homes and role of other state agencies in abuse investigations. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is responsible for ensuring nursing homes meet federal quality standards, including that residents are free from abuse. CMS enters into agreements with state survey agencies to conduct surveys of the state's homes and to investigate complaints and incidents. GAO analysis of CMS data found that, while relatively rare, abuse deficiencies cited in nursing homes more than doubled, increasing from 430 in 2013 to 875 in 2017, with the largest increase in severe cases. GAO also reviewed a representative sample of abuse deficiency narratives from 2016 through 2017. Physical and mental/verbal abuse occurred most often in nursing homes, followed by sexual abuse, and staff were more often the perpetrators of the abuse deficiencies cited. CMS cannot readily access information on abuse or perpetrator type in its data and, therefore, lacks key information critical to taking appropriate actions. GAO also found gaps in CMS oversight, including: Gaps in CMS processes that can result in delayed and missed referrals. Federal law requires nursing home staff to immediately report to law enforcement and the state survey agency reasonable suspicions of a crime that results in serious bodily injury to a resident. However, there is no equivalent requirement that the state survey agency make a timely referral for complaints it receives directly or through surveys it conducts. CMS also does not conduct oversight to ensure that state survey agencies are correctly referring abuse cases to law enforcement. Insufficient information collected on facility-reported incidents. CMS has not issued guidance on what nursing homes should include when they self-report abuse incidents to the state survey agencies. Officials from all of the state survey agencies in GAO's review said the facility-reported incidents can lack information needed to prioritize investigations and may result in state survey agencies not responding as quickly as needed. GAO is making six recommendations, including that CMS: require state survey agencies to submit data on abuse and perpetrator type; require state survey agencies to immediately refer to law enforcement any suspicion of a crime; and develop guidance on what abuse information nursing homes should self-report. HHS concurred with all of GAO's recommendations and identified actions it will take to implement them.\n","   4  Decades of defense activities at DOE's Idaho National Laboratory produced two forms of waste that EM has managed as HLW: liquid SBW and granular calcine waste. Under an agreement with the state, DOE must treat the waste to prepare it for removal from Idaho by 2035. Construction on the IWTU, EM's facility to treat such waste, was completed in 2012, but initial testing of the SBW treatment process revealed design problems. EM has since been working to reengineer the IWTU. Total project construction and reengineering expenditures have reached nearly $1 billion as of February 2019. GAO was asked to review EM's efforts to treat and dispose of the SBW and calcine waste. This report examines (1) the extent to which EM's management of the IWTU follows selected project management best practices; (2) challenges EM faces in disposing of the SBW; and (3) challenges EM faces in treating and disposing of the calcine waste. GAO reviewed agency documents and IWTU project data from March 2017 through February 2018, analyzed EM project management efforts against selected project management best practices for cost and schedule, and interviewed DOE officials. The Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) has not fully followed selected project management best practices in managing the reengineering of the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU), shown in the figure, to treat 900,000 gallons of liquid sodium-bearing waste (SBW) that must be solidified for disposal. EM's cost and schedule estimates for IWTU reengineering did not fully meet selected best practices for cost (i.e., did not account for all costs) and schedule estimates (e.g., did not have a valid critical path). For example, EM did not follow best practices for a comprehensive cost estimate because EM did not include both government and contractor costs over the entire project. As of February 2019, EM has experienced approximately $64 million in added costs and a more than 1-year delay in IWTU reengineering. Without fully following best practices for cost and schedule estimates, EM is at risk of future cost overruns and delays in meeting its target disposal milestones. Based on GAO's review of EM documents, EM faces challenges with its plans for SBW disposal at its preferred disposal site, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), an underground repository for waste contaminated by nuclear elements, near Carlsbad, New Mexico. These challenges include a statutory prohibition on the disposal of high-level waste (HLW) at WIPP. Further, EM does not have a strategy or timeline to address these challenges or to identify an alternative disposal pathway. Without such a strategy or timeline, EM risks not meeting its commitments with Idaho to prepare the SBW for removal from the state by 2035. EM faces challenges implementing its selected technology to further treat 1.2 million gallons of granular calcine waste and selecting a potential waste disposal pathway. For example, DOE has identified challenges with retrofitting the IWTU for calcine waste treatment. As a result, EM is deferring further development of its plans to treat the calcine waste. EM officials said that the agency is making progress toward calcine waste disposal by testing options for removing the waste from its storage bins, a precursor to treating or packaging the waste for disposal. However, EM does not have a strategy or timeline for determining its next steps for the treatment and disposal of calcine waste. Such a strategy could help EM in seeking alternatives to its selected treatment technology and provide assurance that it will meet its commitments with Idaho for removing calcine waste from the state by the end of 2035. GAO is making five recommendations, including that DOE develop a strategy for the disposal of the waste. DOE generally agreed with all of these recommendations.\n","   5  Federal agencies publish on average 3,700 proposed rules yearly and are generally required to provide interested persons (commenters) an opportunity to comment on these rules. In recent years, some high-profile rulemakings have received extremely large numbers of comments, raising questions about how agencies manage the identity information associated with comments. While the APA does not require the disclosure of identifying information from a commenter, agencies may choose to collect this information. This testimony summarizes GAO's June 2019 report on public comment posting practices (GAO-19-483). In that report, GAO examined (1) the identity information collected by comment websites; (2) the guidance agencies have related to the identity of commenters; (3) how 10 selected agencies treat identity information; and (4) the extent to which the selected agencies clearly communicate their practices associated with identity information. The 10 agencies were selected on the basis of the volume of public comments they received on rulemakings. For this testimony, GAO obtained updates on the status of recommendations made to the selected agencies. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) governs the process by which many federal agencies develop and issue regulations, which includes the public comment process (see figure below). In June 2019, GAO found that Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment websites collect some identity information—such as name, email, or address—from commenters who choose to provide it during the public comment process. The APA does not require commenters to disclose identity information when submitting comments. In addition, agencies have no obligation under the APA to verify the identity of such parties during the rulemaking process, and all selected agencies accept anonymous comments in practice. GAO found in the June 2019 report that seven of 10 selected agencies have some internal guidance associated with the identity of commenters, but the substance of this guidance varies. This reflects the differences in the way that the selected agencies handle commenter identity information internally. GAO also found that the selected agencies' practices for posting public comments to comment websites vary considerably, particularly for duplicate comments (identical or near-identical comment text but varied identity information). For example, one agency posts a single example of duplicate comments and indicates the total number of comments received, but only the example is available to public users of Regulations.gov. In contrast, other agencies post all comments individually. As a result, identity information submitted with comments is inconsistently presented on public websites. The APA allows agencies discretion in how they post comments, but GAO found that some of the selected agencies do not clearly communicate their practices for how comments and identity information are posted. GAO's key practices for transparently reporting government data state that federal government websites should disclose data sources and limitations to help public users make informed decisions about how to use the data. If not, public users of the comment websites could reach inaccurate conclusions about who submitted a particular comment, or how many individuals commented on an issue. In June 2019, GAO made recommendations to eight of the selected agencies regarding implementing and communicating public comment posting policies. The agencies generally agreed with the recommendations and identified actions they planned to take in response. Since the June 2019 report, one agency has implemented GAO's recommendation and seven agencies have identified additional planned actions.\n","   6  Since 2000, there has been substantial growth in Medicare payments for hospice services and the number of Medicare beneficiaries using hospice. This growth has been accompanied by an increase in the number of providers (primarily an increase in for-profit providers), reaching approximately 4,500 providers by 2017. GAO was asked to review aspects of Medicare's hospice program. This report, among other things, (1) compares quality scores and other potential indicators of quality for for-profit and non-profit hospices; and (2) examines opportunities for strengthening CMS's oversight of hospice providers. GAO analyzed CMS data on hospice care for 2014 through 2017—the latest years for which full-year data were available at the time of GAO's analysis—and reviewed research on hospice care. GAO interviewed CMS officials, researchers, provider associations, a survey agency association, and a non-generalizable sample of hospice providers selected in part through referrals from other stakeholders. GAO also reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, documents, and enforcement data. Medicare's hospice benefit provides palliative care to beneficiaries with terminal illnesses and a life expectancy of 6 months or less. GAO's review of 2017 data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) found that for-profit and non-profit hospices had, on average, similar scores on CMS's current quality measures that indicate hospice performance in areas such as pain assessment and discussion of beneficiary treatment preferences. However, for-profits were more often among the subset of providers with the lowest scores on certain quality measures GAO reviewed. In addition to analyzing providers' scores on CMS quality measures, GAO analyzed provider performance on other indicators, identified by researchers, that could signal quality issues and found performance varied among for-profit and non-profit hospices. One of the other quality indicators GAO analyzed was the rate of beneficiaries discharged from hospice prior to death, which in some cases could indicate dissatisfaction with care leading to the beneficiary's decision to leave the hospice provider. In addition, GAO examined the number of provider visits to give medical and emotional support within the last few days of a beneficiary's life. With regard to these indicators, for 2017, GAO found the following, among other things: 472 hospice providers (462 for-profits and 10 non-profits) had a high rate of discharging beneficiaries prior to death (50 percent or more were discharged). According to research, a high discharge rate could, in some cases, be an indicator of poor quality of care or of provider misuse of the benefit, in that the hospice may be enrolling beneficiares who are not eligible for hospice care. 83 providers (80 for-profits and 3 non-profits) did not have hospice staff (such as nurses, physicians, or nurse practitioners) visit beneficiaries within the last 3 days of their life—a critical time in providing quality care, according to researchers GAO interviewed. CMS's oversight of the quality of care provided by hospice providers consists primarily of inspections—called surveys—of hospice providers. GAO found that, while CMS instructs surveyors to review previous survey findings and complaints, CMS does not instruct surveyors to use information on providers' performance on quality measures or other potential indicators of quality as part of the survey process. For example, CMS does not instruct surveyors to consider whether a hospice provided staff visits during beneficiaries' last week of life. According to research, this information could be used to enhance the survey process. GAO also found that CMS is limited to one enforcement option—termination of the Medicare provider agreement—which CMS uses rarely and generally only when providers fail to correct within the required time frame the most serious violations of federal health and safety requirements. According to two researchers, additional remedies, such as civil monetary penalties, could enhance CMS's oversight by addressing performance problems that do not merit termination and incentivize agencies to improve quality of care. CMS uses a range of remedies for other provider types, such as home health agencies and nursing homes, but lacks authority to impose such additional sanctions on hospices. CMS should incorporate the use of additional information that could be used to identify quality of care issues into its survey process for hospice oversight. Congress should consider giving CMS authority to establish additional enforcement remedies for hospices that do not meet federal health and safety requirements. The Department of Health and Human Services concurred with GAO's recommendation.\n","   7  Third-party providers, such as paid tax return preparers and tax preparation software providers, greatly impact IRS’s administration of the tax system. If these third parties do not properly secure taxpayers’ personal and financial information, taxpayers will be vulnerable to identity theft refund fraud and their sensitive personal information will be at risk of unauthorized disclosure. IRS estimates that it paid out at least $110 million in identity theft tax refund fraud during 2017, and at least $1.6 billion in identity theft tax refund fraud during 2016. GAO was asked to review IRS’s efforts to track, monitor, and deter theft of taxpayer information from third parties. Among other things, this report assesses what is known about the taxpayer information security requirements for the systems used by third-party providers, IRS’s processes for monitoring compliance with these requirements, and IRS’s requirements for third-party security incident reporting. GAO analyzed IRS’s information security requirements, standards, and guidance for third-party providers and compared them to relevant laws, regulations, and leading practices, such as NIST guidance and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government . GAO reviewed IRS’s monitoring procedures and its requirements and processes for third-party reporting of security incidents, and compared them to Internal Control Standards and GAO’s A Framework for Managing Fraud Risk in Federal Programs . GAO also interviewed IRS and tax industry group officials. Federal law and guidance require that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the sensitive financial and taxpayer information that resides on its systems. However, taxpayer information held by third-party providers—such as paid tax return preparers and tax preparation software providers—generally falls outside of these requirements, according to IRS officials. In 2018, about 90 percent of individual taxpayers had their tax returns electronically filed by paid preparers or used tax preparation software to prepare and file their own returns. IRS seeks to help safeguard electronic tax return filing for various types of third-party providers through requirements under its Authorized e-file Provider program. However, IRS’s efforts do not provide assurance that taxpayers’ information is being adequately protected. Paid Preparers. IRS has not developed minimum information security requirements for the systems used by paid preparers or Authorized e-file Providers. According to IRS’s Office of Chief Counsel, IRS does not have the explicit authority to regulate security for these systems. Instead, the Internal Revenue Code gives IRS broad authority to administer and supervise the internal revenue laws. The Department of the Treasury has previously requested additional authority to regulate the competency of all paid preparers; GAO has also suggested that Congress consider granting IRS this authority. Congress has not yet provided such authority. Neither the Department of the Treasury request nor the GAO suggestion included granting IRS authority to regulate the security of paid preparers’ systems. Having such authority would enable IRS to establish minimum requirements. Further, having explicit authority to establish security standards for Authorized e-file Providers’ systems may help IRS better ensure the protection of taxpayers’ information. Tax Software Providers. As part of a public-private partnership between IRS and the tax preparation industry, 15 tax software providers voluntarily adhere to a set of about 140 information security controls developed using guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). However, these controls are not required, and these providers represent only about one-third of all tax software providers. Additionally, IRS established six security, privacy, and business standards for providers of software that allows individuals to prepare their own tax returns (as opposed to software that paid preparers use). However, IRS has not substantially updated these standards since 2010, and they are, at least in part, outdated. For example, IRS cites an outdated encryption standard that NIST recommends not using due to its many known weaknesses. A key factor contributing to missed opportunities to address third-party cybersecurity is IRS’s lack of centralized leadership. Consequently, IRS is less able to ensure that third-party providers adequately protect taxpayers’ information, which may result in identity theft refund fraud. IRS monitors compliance with its electronic tax return filing program requirements for those paid preparers who electronically file returns; however, IRS’s monitoring has a limited focus on cybersecurity issues. For example, the monitoring techniques largely focus on physical security (e.g., locked filing cabinets) rather than verifying that preparers have an information security policy consistent with NIST-recommended controls. Without effective monitoring of cybersecurity controls, IRS has limited assurance that those paid preparers’ systems have adequate controls in place to protect clients’ data. IRS recently began collecting information on high-risk security incidents, such as hackers infiltrating third-party provider systems. Reported incidents increased from 2017 to 2018, the only years for which IRS has data. However, IRS does not have a full picture of the scope of incidents because of inconsistent reporting requirements, including no reporting requirements for paid preparers. GAO suggests that Congress consider providing IRS with explicit authority to establish security requirements for paid preparers’ and Authorized e-file Providers’ systems. GAO is also making eight recommendations, including that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Develop a governance structure or other form of centralized leadership to coordinate all aspects of IRS’s efforts to protect taxpayer information while at third-party providers. Require all tax software providers to adhere to prescribed information security controls. Regularly review and update security standards for tax software providers. Update IRS’s monitoring programs to include basic cybersecurity issues. Standardize incident reporting requirements for all types of third-party providers. IRS agreed with three recommendations, including the above recommendations to regularly review and update security standards for tax software providers, and standardize incident reporting requirements. IRS disagreed with five recommendations—including the other three listed above—generally citing the lack of clear and explicit authority it would need to establish security requirements for the information systems of paid preparers and Authorized e-file Providers. GAO believes that IRS can implement these recommendations without additional statutory authority.\n","   8  The CCDF is administered as a block grant to the states by OCC, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Recent reports by the HHS Office of the Inspector General show that OCC's monitoring of CCDF state program-integrity efforts remains a challenge. CCDF has also been designated as a program susceptible to significant improper payments, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget. GAO was asked to review CCDF program-integrity efforts. This report discusses, among other things, the extent to which OCC provides oversight of (1) states' CCDF program-integrity activities, including encouraging that all requested information is included within State Plans; and (2) improper-payment risks and relevant corrective actions in states' CCDF programs. GAO analyzed 51 approved CCDF State Plans, including from the District of Columbia, for the fiscal years 2019–2021 grant period. GAO also reviewed OCC policies and procedures and compared them to relevant laws, regulations, and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government , and interviewed relevant federal officials. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) provided states more than $8 billion in federal funds in fiscal year 2019. The Office of Child Care (OCC) oversees the integrity of the CCDF, which subsidizes child care for low-income families. A key part of OCC's oversight includes reviewing and approving State Plans. OCC requested but did not require states to describe in their State Plans the results of their program-integrity activities, which describe the processes that states use to identify fraud risk. Further, OCC has not defined or communicated what information it considers to be the “results” of program-integrity activities to the states and its own staff. Without defining and communicating its informational needs, OCC may continue to lack quality information that could help ensure states' accountability over their program-integrity activities. OCC oversees states' improper payment risks through a process that includes a requirement for states to submit corrective action plans (CAP) when they estimate their annual payment error rates are at or above 10 percent. Since 2013, seven states have submitted 14 CAPs. These CAPs describe states' proposed actions for reducing improper payments. However, OCC does not have documented criteria to guide its review and approval of the CAPs to ensure the proposed corrective actions are aimed at root causes of improper payments and are effectively implemented. Without developing this guidance, OCC does not have assurance that proposed corrective actions are specifically aimed at root causes of improper payments, leaving the CCDF program at continued risk of improper payments. GAO is making nine recommendations, including that OCC define and communicate its informational needs on the results of states' program-integrity activities, and that OCC develop criteria to guide the review of CAPs to ensure that proposed corrective actions are aimed at root causes of improper payments and are effectively implemented. HHS concurred with our recommendations and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.\n","   9  PMIAA requires OMB to adopt program management standards and guidelines government-wide; OPM is to establish new—or revise existing—occupational standards for program and project management. PMIAA includes a provision for GAO, no later than 3 years after the enactment of the act, to issue a report examining the implementation and effectiveness of certain provisions of the act on federal program and project management. This report (1) describes steps taken by OMB, OPM, and agencies to implement PMIAA; (2) assesses OMB's efforts to address issues on GAO's High-Risk List using PMIAA; and (3) examines the extent to which OMB provided methods for agencies to measure and assess the results of PMIAA. GAO reviewed documents from and conducted interviews with OMB and OPM. GAO surveyed all 24 CFO Act agencies, and selected five agencies to illustrate implementation efforts. GAO also interviewed subject matter specialists from academia and the private sector regarding their views on how program and project management practices applied to PMIAA. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has begun to implement all requirements of the Program Management Improvement Accountabilitiy Act of 2016 (PMIAA), but further efforts are needed to fully implement the law. OMB released its 5-year strategic plan for PMIAA and developed program management standards. However, the standards are not detailed compared with accepted program and project management standards, and OMB's governance structure is insufficient for developing and maintaining these standards over time. In 2019, OMB conducted ten reviews of agency program portfolios—organized groupings of programs whose coordination in implementation enables agencies to achieve their objectives. Each review addressed one or two portfolios per agency. Further, OMB's required portfolio reviews of high-risk areas were limited to only five out of 35 areas on GAO's High-Risk List. OMB could establish measures to track agencies' progress. Although not required by PMIAA, this is a good practice for demonstrating improvement. As required by PMIAA, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) developed competencies for program and project managers and updated the program management job series. Further, OPM is developing a career path for program and project managers by the end of 2019. OPM also plans to create a unique job identifier code in 2020 so that agencies can more completely identify their program management workforce. The Program Management Policy Council (PMPC), established by PMIAA and chaired by OMB's Deputy Director for Management, met for the first time in September 2018 and met twice in 2019 to discuss PMIAA implementation with Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies. All CFO Act agencies designated a Program Management Improvement Officer to participate in the PMPC. However, the PMPC has neither addressed GAO high-risk areas nor advised OMB on how to address high-risk areas, as required by the PMIAA. GAO is making eight recommendations that OMB further develop the standards to include more detail, create a governance structure for program management standards, hold meetings on all High-Risk List areas, and establish measures to track agencies' progress in program management. OMB neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations and stated that it would consider them when making future updates to its program management policies and guidance.\n","  10  Nationwide, about 1.4 million elderly or disabled individuals receive care in more than 15,500 nursing homes. CMS, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), defines standards nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Nursing home residents often have physical or cognitive limitations that can leave them particularly vulnerable to abuse. Abuse of nursing home residents can occur in many forms—including physical, mental, verbal, and sexual—and can be committed by staff, residents, or others in the nursing home. Any incident of abuse is a serious occurrence and can result in potentially devastating consequences for residents, including lasting mental anguish, serious injury, or death. This statement summarizes GAO's June 2019 report, GAO-19-433 . Specifically, it describes: (1) the trends and types of abuse in recent years, and (2) CMS's oversight intended to ensure residents are free from abuse. It also includes a brief summary of findings and recommendations from this June 2019 report and prior GAO reports that examined the health and welfare of the elderly in multiple settings, and the status, as of November 2019, of HHS's efforts to implement the recommendations GAO made. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is responsible for ensuring nursing homes meet federal quality standards, including that residents are free from abuse. CMS enters into agreements with state survey agencies to conduct surveys of the state's homes and to investigate complaints and incidents. GAO's June 2019 report found that, while abuse deficiencies cited in nursing homes were relatively rare from 2013 through 2017, they more than doubled during that time, increasing from 430 in 2013 to 875 in 2017, with the largest increase in severe cases. In light of the increased number and severity of abuse deficiencies, it is imperative that CMS have strong nursing home oversight in place to protect residents from abuse. However, GAO found oversight gaps that may limit the agency's ability to do so. Specifically, GAO found: (1) Information on abuse and perpetrator types is not readily available. CMS's data do not allow for the type of abuse or perpetrator to be readily identified by the agency. Specifically, CMS does not require the state survey agencies to record abuse and perpetrator type and, when this information is recorded, it cannot be easily analyzed by CMS. GAO made a recommendation that CMS require state survey agencies to submit data on abuse and perpetrator type and HHS concurred. As of November 2019, HHS had not implemented the recommendation. (2) Facility-reported incidents lack key information. Despite federal law requiring nursing homes to self-report allegations of abuse and covered individuals to report reasonable suspicions of crimes against residents, CMS has not provided guidance to nursing homes on what information they should include in facility-reported incidents, contributing to a lack of information for state survey agencies and delays in their investigations. GAO made a recommendation that CMS develop guidance on what abuse information nursing homes should self-report and HHS concurred. As of November 2019, HHS had not implemented the recommendation. (3) Gaps exist in the CMS process for state survey agency referrals to law enforcement. GAO found gaps in CMS's process for referring incidents of abuse to law enforcement. These gaps may limit CMS's ability to ensure that nursing homes meet federal requirements for residents to be free from abuse. Specifically, GAO identified issues related to (1) referring abuse to law enforcement in a timely manner, (2) tracking abuse referrals, (3) defining what it means to substantiate an allegation of abuse—that is, the determination by the state survey agency that evidence supports the abuse allegation, and (4) sharing information with law enforcement. GAO made four recommendations to address these gaps and HHS concurred. As of November 2019, HHS had not implemented these recommendations.\n","  11  VA receives billions of dollars per year to provide health care and disability compensation to promote the wellness of veterans with service-connected conditions. VA studies veterans' health through research and assesses changes in service-connected conditions through its reevaluation process. GAO was asked to review VA's efforts to study and gauge the health outcomes of veterans with service-connected conditions. This report examines the extent to which (1) veterans used VA health care services to treat service-connected conditions, and what is known about their health outcomes; (2) VA uses information on reevaluations to help manage the program; and (3) VA's procedures position it to determine when to conduct a reevaluation. GAO reviewed fiscal year 2018 VA health care data; selected studies; VA data on completed reevaluations from fiscal years 2013-2018; and relevant federal laws, regulations, and program guidance. GAO also interviewed staff at four VA regional offices (selected for variation in claims workload and location) and VA officials at the agency's central office. In fiscal year 2018, about 54 percent of veterans receiving Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation had at least one VA outpatient visit to treat an injury or illness that VA deemed was incurred or aggravated during military service (i.e., a service-connected condition). However, the health outcomes of veterans with service-connected conditions, such as changes in the severity of symptoms or the incidence of mortality, are not well understood. Information about health outcomes is central to ensuring veterans' wellness and assessing improvement in their disability status. According to VA researchers GAO spoke with and academic studies GAO reviewed, various challenges have limited research on this population. For example, data reside in different VA systems and use different identifiers for medical conditions, hindering use of the data. While VA has begun to consider ways to analyze health outcomes, it has not yet established a plan for this effort, including the scope, specific activities, and timeframes for addressing the identified research challenges. VA does not glean information from the results of reevaluations to help manage its disability compensation program. Disability reevaluations help VA gauge whether veterans' service-connected conditions have changed, and whether disability compensation should be modified to reflect those changes (see figure). However, VA does not fully use key management information, such as: trends in how frequently certain conditions are reevaluated, including those required by VA regulations to be reevaluated; and outcomes of reevaluation decisions for individual conditions (i.e., whether conditions worsened or improved). Both trend and outcome information could help VA better target its resources toward reevaluating conditions more likely to change. VA recently updated its procedures manual to specify which staff may determine whether a veteran's condition should be reevaluated, but has not clearly defined skill sets and training needed to consistently implement these procedures. Specifically, the updated procedures do not indicate the knowledge, skills, and abilities staff need to determine when to conduct reevaluations. Further, VA has not ensured that training aligns with these needed skillsets. Without improving procedures and training, VA is at risk of conducting unnecessary reevaluations and burdening veterans. GAO is making five recommendations, including that VA develop a plan to address challenges to studying health outcomes, use information on reevaluations to improve program management, and improve procedures and training for reevaluations. VA agreed with two recommendations and agreed in principle with the other three, but its proposed actions do not fully address GAO's concerns.\n","  12  As of March 2018, more than 1.2 million foreign students in the United States were enrolled in 8,774 schools certified by SEVP. ICE is responsible for managing SEVP, which certifies schools to enroll foreign students. Various ICE offices have a role in preventing, detecting, and responding to potential fraud in the program. GAO was asked to review potential vulnerabilities to fraud in SEVP. GAO examined, among other things, the extent to which ICE (1) implemented controls to address fraud risks in the school certification and recertification processes and (2) implemented fraud risk controls related to DSO training. GAO analyzed ICE policies and documentation, including fraud risk guidance and procedures for school certification and recertification; analyzed 2013 through 2017 recertification data; and interviewed officials from five ICE field offices that GAO selected based on their experience investigating program fraud. GAO also interviewed officials from 17 selected schools located near these ICE field offices. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in November 2018. Information that DHS deemed sensitive has been omitted. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has identified several fraud risks to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). As shown in the figure below, these include risks associated with school owners and designated school officials (DSO) who help ICE oversee students in the program. These fraud risks may occur as schools apply to become SEVP-certified, accept foreign students, and apply for recertification every 2 years. ICE has implemented controls to address fraud risks related to school certification, but long-standing delays in recertifying these schools exacerbate fraud risks. By statute and regulation, ICE must conduct recertification reviews every 2 years to ensure that schools continue to meet program requirements—an important fraud risk control. Between 2013 and 2017, ICE recertified about 12,900 schools. However, according to ICE officials, they have been unable to meet the 2-year time frame and, as of June 2018, had 3,281 recertification petitions waiting for review. To help manage its queue, ICE has lengthened the period between recertification reviews by extending schools' certification expiration dates by 180 days, which is inconsistent with its regulation and may allow fraudulent schools to operate longer without detection. Although ICE is taking steps to increase resources for recertification, it is unclear whether these steps will ensure recertification is conducted consistently with ICE regulations. ICE relies on DSOs to, among other things, update and maintain foreign-student data in ICE's foreign-student information system and report suspected fraud to ICE. However, ICE does not provide DSOs with training that addresses fraud risks to the program. In June 2018, ICE officials stated that they plan to develop this fraud training for DSOs, but do not have documented plans or timelines for when it would be completed. By developing these plans, the agency would be better positioned to ensure that DSOs receive the training needed to address potential fraud in the program. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that ICE (1) notify schools 180 days prior to the 2-year certification expiration date, as required, and evaluate whether additional resources for recertification are needed, and (2) develop a plan to implement fraud-specific training for DSOs. ICE concurred with all of GAO's recommendations.\n","  13  The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Zika virus a public health emergency of international concern in February 2016. According to WHO, as of March 2017, 79 countries and territories—including 48 in the Western Hemisphere—reported evidence of ongoing Zika transmission. In April 2016, USAID and State repurposed $215 million for Zika from funds appropriated for Ebola. Subsequently, the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, provided over $175 million in supplemental funding to USAID and State to support Zika response efforts overseas. The act also included a provision for GAO to review the status of USAID and State actions to respond to Zika. In March 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention downgraded its international travel warning for Zika. This report examines (1) the status of USAID and State funding for U.S. Zika response overseas, (2) activities supported by these funds, and (3) implementation challenges, if any, and responses to any challenges. GAO reviewed information from U.S. agencies and met with U.S. and host country officials in Washington, D.C. GAO also conducted fieldwork in a nongeneralizable sample of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean where agencies implemented key response activities. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of State (State) obligated $385 million of the total $390 million available for international Zika response and disbursed $264 million as of September 2018. USAID obligated 95 percent of the total funding. USAID and State provided some country information to Congress but did not provide, or take steps to track, funding on a country basis. According to USAID officials, tracking funding information by country would be helpful in the future. The ability to compile funding by country when responding to future infectious disease outbreaks would enable USAID to provide additional information to key decision makers to better support spending oversight and inform budgetary and planning decisions. In response to the Zika outbreak, USAID and State supported a broad range of activities overseas, including mosquito control, research efforts, and medical evacuations. In one activity, USAID implementing partners monitored mosquito populations; in another, they researched methods to reduce Zika virus transmission rates. USAID implementing partners reported various outputs from selected activities. For example, an implementing partner reported that its awareness campaign on Zika prevention reached more than 5 million people. USAID faced sustainability and timeliness challenges in implementing its Zika response. According to agency and other officials, one-time funding and a short time frame posed a challenge related to sustainability of Zika response activities. In response, USAID worked to align activities with those of host governments and other organizations so they could continue in the long term. However, USAID's emergency response planning did not fully address the challenge of timely implementation of response activities in countries without bilateral USAID health programs. Twenty-two of 26 countries with Zika response activities did not have bilateral USAID health programs when the Zika outbreak began. As a result, response activities took additional time to deploy in some countries where USAID first had to establish relationships with key host country officials. Although USAID developed an infectious disease response plan in 2018, the plan does not provide guidance on how to address the timely implementation challenge in countries without bilateral health programs. By improving its planning, such as by adding such guidance in its 2018 plan, USAID would be better positioned to respond quickly to future disease outbreaks. USAID should (1) take steps to ensure it is able to compile funding information by country for future infectious disease emergency responses and (2) take steps to improve its infectious disease response planning. USAID concurred with GAO's recommendations.\n","  14  The United States, which relies on imports for most of the seafood it consumes, imported about $40 billion in fishery products in 2018. Seafood imports often involve complex supply chains, which may include forced labor. A 2017 United Nations report estimated that there are 24.9 million people in forced labor around the world, 12 percent of whom work in the agriculture and fishing sectors. Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended in 2016, prohibits the importation of goods, including seafood, produced or manufactured, wholly or in part, in any foreign country by forced labor, among other things. GAO was asked to review CBP's enforcement of section 307. This report examines (1) the process CBP uses to enforce section 307 for seafood imports and the results of its civil enforcement actions; and (2) the external sources of information CBP uses to help carry out enforcement of section 307 for seafood imports and stakeholder perspectives on CBP's communication of its information needs. GAO reviewed laws and CBP documents pertaining to section 307 enforcement and interviewed officials from CBP, other federal agencies, and 18 NGO stakeholders. GAO selected NGOs with various goals and missions related to seafood and forced labor. The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses a four-phase process to enforce section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which prohibits imports produced with forced labor, including seafood. CBP's Forced Labor Division, established in 2018, largely carries out this process. In phase 1, CBP assesses leads when deciding to initiate a case involving potential forced labor. In phase 2, CBP investigates cases using a variety of information to determine whether evidentiary standards have been met. In phase 3, CBP reviews information for legal sufficiency and, in phase 4, may take action at a port of entry to detain imports in violation by issuing a withhold release order. Between 2016 and March 2020, CBP issued one order for seafood, prohibiting tuna shipments from a specific fishing vessel from entering U.S. commerce. CBP uses information from external sources to help enforce section 307 for seafood imports but may miss opportunities to obtain key information from stakeholders. CBP officials said they use media reports and information from federal agencies and stakeholders to develop forced labor cases. For example, CBP initiated the case that resulted in the seafood order based partly on media reports and investigated it using vessel data from the Department of Commerce. CBP officials said that stakeholders such as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) often have firsthand accounts of forced labor—valuable information for investigations. However, most stakeholders told GAO that they do not have a clear understanding of the information CBP needs to investigate seafood cases because CBP has not communicated such information. For example, CBP's website provides general information about what individuals can submit if forced labor is suspected but does not provide specific types of information that could be useful. With better communication to stakeholders about the types of information it needs to develop forced labor cases, CBP may be able to improve its enforcement efforts. GAO recommends that CBP better communicate to stakeholders the types of information stakeholders could collect and submit to CBP to help the agency initiate and investigate forced labor cases related to seafood and, as appropriate, other goods. CBP agreed with GAO's recommendation.\n","  15  As DOD increased its reliance on special operations forces, SOCOM's budget has increased from $5.2 billion in 2005 to $12.3 billion in 2018. Section 922 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 included provisions to enhance the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict's responsibilities to be similar to those of a military department secretary regarding the organization, training, and equipping of special operations forces. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the fiscal year 2018 NDAA included a provision for GAO to assess DOD's actions in response to section 922. This report assesses (1) the extent to which DOD has identified and taken actions to implement section 922; (2) what, if any, challenges it faces in completing implementation; and (3) the extent to which its hiring approach for the office of the ASD-SO/LIC has incorporated strategic workforce planning principles. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed DOD officials. Since 2017 the Department of Defense (DOD) has made recommendations, developed actions, and taken steps to address requirements in section 922 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 to expand the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict's (ASD-SO/LIC) roles and responsibilities. DOD officials noted that they have taken an incremental implementation approach to addressing section 922. In 2018, DOD identified 166 recommendations to change the ASD-SO/LIC's oversight of special operations forces (SOF). These recommendations were used to develop 87 actions that were necessary to implement section 922. Since February 2019, DOD has implemented 56 of these actions. For example, the Deputy Secretary of Defense approved a new Special Operations Policy and Oversight Council directive that identified the ASD-SO/LIC as the lead for that council. The Deputy Secretary of Defense also delegated the ASD-SO/LIC with authority to approve waivers to hire civilian personnel during a civilian hiring freeze. Although the office of the ASD-SO/LIC has taken many actions to implement section 922, DOD faces two key challenges in completing its implementation of the ASD-SO/LIC's new roles and responsibilities: Lack of time frames . As of February 2019, 28 out of 31 unimplemented actions associated with section 922 did not have clear time frames for implementation. According to ASD-SO/LIC and U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) officials, they did not prioritize establishing time frames because they took an incremental approach to implementing actions and addressed them on a case-by-case basis. Without clear time frames for implementation, ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM may be less effective in implementing section 922. Unclear guidance . Current guidance about ASD-SO/LIC responsibilities is outdated: for example, it states that the ASD-SO/LIC shall report directly to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. However, section 922 states that special operation forces-related administrative matters are managed directly by the Secretary of Defense to the ASD-SO/LIC. The special operations force enterprise is a complex system, and unless roles and responsibilities are clarified in guidance, other DOD stakeholders, such as the military services, may not know the extent of the ASD-SO/LIC's and SOCOM's authorities and responsibilities. DOD officials expressed some concerns that until these matters are clarified in guidance, it will remain unclear whether the ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM should work together—for example, on personnel issues—and how their relationships with stakeholders with oversight authority will be managed. DOD partially concurred, and based on its comments, GAO modified one recommendation. The office of the ASD-SO/LIC has made efforts to develop a workforce plan, including commissioning a manpower study and taking steps to develop a hiring plan; however, these efforts do not fully incorporate some leading principles for a strategic workforce plan. For example, ASD-SO/LIC did not share the hiring plan with its staff, including key officials from the office of the ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM. Without completing a comprehensive strategic workforce plan that includes key principles, the office of the ASD-SO/LIC may not know what gaps exist in skills and competencies in order to develop effective workforce strategies to fill those gaps. These issues could put the office of the ASD-SO/LIC at risk of hiring personnel who may not adequately meet its needs as defined by section 922. GAO is making three recommendations to DOD to establish time frames for section 922 actions; update applicable guidance to clarify roles and responsibilities for the ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM; and develop a strategic workforce plan that incorporates key principles. DOD partially concurred with the recommendations and GAO continues to believe the recommendations are valid, as discussed in the report.

  0  In our prior work, we have found that technological innovation involves not only creating new ideas but also translating those ideas into a new product or service. Innovation, and the research driving it, is inherently risky because the likelihood that research can be translated into a product or service and the ultimate value of that product or service are unknown. The Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology describes the path from innovation to commercialization as comprised of three overarching stages: inventing, transitioning to making, and selling. (See fig. 1 for a description of the path from innovation to commercialization.) FDA and USDA have responsibility for overseeing the safety of the food supply. In general, FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of virtually all domestic and imported food products except those regulated by USDA. USDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of meat, poultry, processed egg products, and catfish. FDA and USDA cooperate with states, tribes, and local food safety and public health agencies to carry out their federal responsibilities. FDA and USDA carry out their responsibilities in part through inspections of facilities where food is produced. The frequency of inspections the agencies conduct varies, as follows: FDA. FDA’s authority requires a risk-based approach, in which inspection rates vary depending on the level of risk associated with a food product. FDA conducts risk-based inspections of high-risk and non-high-risk food facilities. For example, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law in 2011, specified that FDA had to inspect all high-risk domestic facilities at least every 3 years. USDA. Depending on the type of facility, USDA conducts inspections at least once per operating shift or maintains a constant presence. Specifically, USDA conducts carcass-by-carcass inspection at all federally inspected meat and poultry slaughter facilities and verifies that these establishments follow all food safety and humane handling requirements. At facilities that process meat and poultry products, USDA conducts inspections at least once per production shift, following the agency’s longstanding interpretation of its statutes requiring it to do so. Among other things, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires that food additives be approved by FDA before they can be lawfully used in foods. Substances added to food are considered unsafe unless the agency establishes that the use of the food additive, under specific conditions for use, will be safe, or unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) under the conditions of its intended use among qualified experts. As we reported in 2010, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act exempts GRAS substances from the act’s general requirement that companies obtain FDA approval before marketing food containing a new additive. GRAS substances include hundreds of spices and artificial flavors, emulsifiers and binders, vitamins and minerals, and preservatives that manufacturers add to enhance a food’s taste, texture, nutritional content, or shelf life. The GRAS exemption allows companies, without notice to or approval from FDA, to determine whether there is enough support to claim a substance is GRAS. For a company to claim a substance is GRAS, it must conclude that there is common knowledge about the safety of the substance among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate its safety. In addition, as part of their oversight of the food supply, FDA and USDA oversee food labeling of the products under their respective jurisdictions. USDA, by statute, is charged with assuring that products under its jurisdiction, including meat, poultry, and catfish, in interstate or foreign commerce are properly marked, labeled, and packaged. USDA develops and applies the labeling requirements for these products, and food manufacturers are responsible for complying with the USDA labeling rules and adhering to the process maintained by USDA for the evaluation and approval of these product labels. Consistent with its statutes, USDA requires preapproval of all labels before manufacturers can market their products. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits the misbranding of food, which includes food labeling that is false or misleading. Consistent with its statutes, FDA ensures that foods within its jurisdiction are not misbranded by focusing on the labels of products already in the market. FDA establishes regulations for the enforcement of these provisions and issues guidance. Food manufacturers are responsible for compliance with misbranding provisions in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. From time to time, new technologies, such as those used to make cell- cultured meat, generate challenges for FDA’s and USDA’s regulatory structure. Other examples of new food technologies to which federal agencies have needed to adapt include the genetic modification of plants and irradiation of foods. In the case of genetically modified plants, there are no specific regulations addressing products resulting from the manipulation of the genetic material of living seeds. However, under FDA policy, new genetically engineered crop varieties are treated like other foods (including their conventional counterparts) under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act and may not contain either unapproved food additives or contaminants that would adulterate the food. In 1995, FDA established a voluntary pre-market consultation process through which companies are encouraged to notify the agency before marketing a food produced from a genetically modified crop and voluntarily submit a summary of the developer-performed safety assessment. FDA evaluates the safety assessment for any issues that need to be addressed and works with the developer to resolve those issues. In the case of irradiated foods, companies seeking approval for a source of radiation used to treat a food may submit a food additive petition to FDA demonstrating the safety of the proposed use. FDA grants approval only after agency scientists have determined that the proposed use is safe, then the process can be employed commercially. General information about the process of making cell-cultured meat is available, but specific information about the technology being used and the eventual commercial production methods as well as the final products is not yet known. While firms may vary in how they make cell-cultured meat, the general process they use can be described in five phases. However, the technology and methods to commercially produce cell- cultured meat are still in development, and producers, regulators, and consumers do not yet have clarity on what these will entail. The composition of the final product is also not yet known. The general process for making cell-cultured meat contains five phases: biopsy, cell banking, growth, harvest, and food processing. (See fig. 2.) The five-phase process is generally as follows: 1. Biopsy. A biopsy is taken by collecting rice-sized tissue samples from an animal, such as livestock, chicken, or fish. During this and subsequent phases, specific laboratory sanitation procedures are followed, and antibiotics may be used in order to avoid or minimize contamination from bacteria. Growth Media According to researchers and representatives from cell-cultured meat firms, the growth media for cell-cultured meat often contains fetal bovine serum, which is obtained from blood drawn from a bovine fetus at slaughter. However, researchers and representatives from cell-culturing firms we spoke with said they are working to develop growth media that do not contain fetal bovine serum. Representatives from some of these firms also told us that the composition of the growth media, including the exact ingredients and their proportions, can vary based on the specific needs of the cells and the variety of serum used. For example, cell-cultured seafood may have different growth media and environmental requirements than cell-cultured livestock and poultry. 2. Cell banking. Biopsied cells with the most desirable traits are selected and either used immediately for cell growth or frozen to create a cell bank for later use. These desirable traits can be obtained by either selecting existing cells or using genetic engineering methods to insert, delete, or edit the DNA to target desired traits in cells. Examples of desirable traits may include cells that divide quickly, cells that divide a greater number of times, cells that result in a reduced cholesterol or fat content or other desirable nutritional traits, or cells that are more resilient to environmental factors, such as temperature, than other cells. According to agency officials and representatives from cell-cultured meat firms, this phase represents an important opportunity to ensure that the source cells used to initiate commercial production are free of pathogens or other contaminants. 3. Growth. During the cell growth phase, cells are placed in a bioreactor and begin to divide and differentiate. A bioreactor is a container that creates an environment that can sustain the growth of cells and includes the ability to control factors such as temperature, pH, and oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. Bioreactors can vary in size, including microwave-sized and refrigerator-sized units, but could be as large as 20 to 30 feet tall in commercial production. Bioreactors contain a growth medium, which may include ingredients such as glucose, amino acids, hormones and other growth factors, and other basic nutrients that cells need to consume in order to thrive. In addition to the medium needed for growth, the cells may need to be attached to a structure, referred to as a scaffold, to properly develop into cell-cultured meat. 4. Harvest. Once the cells have divided to form a sufficiently large amount of cell-cultured meat, producers remove—or harvest—it from the growth medium and bioreactor. If a scaffold was used to provide a structure for cells to grow on, then the cell-cultured meat would either be separated from the scaffold during harvesting or left attached to an edible scaffold. 5. Food processing. The harvested cell-cultured meat is then prepared into a product such as meatballs or chicken nuggets. In the future, products similar to intact cuts of meat such as steak or chicken breast may be produced. The technology to produce cell-cultured meat at a commercial scale is still in development, and information about the methods to be used for commercial production and the composition of the final product are not yet known. In the continuum of moving a technology from innovation to commercialization, cell-cultured meat firms are in the middle stage of building and testing their prototypes, based on our discussions with representatives from these firms. Consequently, they have not finalized aspects of the technology and eventual commercial production methods to be used or the composition of the final product. As a result, certain information is not yet available to stakeholders—including cell-cultured meat firms themselves, regulators, and the public—about specific aspects of the technology and commercial production methods that will be used, such as the composition of the growth medium and of the final products. In addition to technology development, the scarcity of publicly available research on cell-cultured meat production limits information available to agency officials and the public. Each cell-cultured meat firm is developing detailed information on its own eventual commercial production methods for making cell-cultured meat. However, the firms, similar to other technology start-ups, are reluctant to disclose intellectual property and business-sensitive information due to concerns about competition. For example, one firm told us that they can reverse engineer parts of another company’s commercial production method by seeing pictures of the equipment the other company is using. In addition, cell-cultured meat firms compete with other firms for funding from sources such as venture capitalists, foreign governments, and conventional meat companies. This competition for funding contributes to firms being reluctant to share information they consider important intellectual property, such as parts of their production processes. As a result, agency officials and other stakeholders told us that they must largely rely on whatever information the cell-cultured meat firms are willing to provide to understand details of the companies’ prototype processes and products. This limitation can affect agencies’ ability to make regulatory and other decisions. Specifically, FDA and USDA officials said they have limited information on cell-cultured meat production methods and products and need more in order to regulate this new food. One USDA official explained that the agency cannot establish labeling requirements if the agency does not know the nutritional profile of the final product. For example, if the scaffold on which the cell-cultured meat is grown is not edible, the agencies may require firms to disclose certain aspects of their commercial production methods, such as how they removed the cell- cultured meat from the scaffold. However, if the scaffold is edible, it will affect the final composition of the product, which may require different labeling than a product that was developed without edible scaffolding. This lack of information results in unanswered questions about cell- cultured meat as it relates to the eventual technology and commercial production methods to be used and the composition of the final products. Among other things, this lack of information creates challenges for industry and federal regulatory agencies as cell-cultured meat nears commercialization. The sources we reviewed and stakeholders we talked to identified a number of open questions, including the following: Tissue collection. How often will producers need to collect biopsy samples from animals, and what animals will be used? Some stakeholders have stated concerns about whether, and how, regulators will ensure that biopsies are collected from healthy animals. For example, one cell-cultured meat firm stated that tissue samples would be taken from slaughtered donor animals that met federal standards for conventional processing at the time of slaughter. However, USDA and FDA have not indicated whether they would require cell-cultured meat firms to do so. Additionally, representatives from cell-cultured meat firms stated that they did not yet know how frequently they would need to collect biopsies from animals for commercial-level production. Additionally, according to researchers, there are too many unknowns to accurately estimate how much cell- cultured meat could be produced from a single biopsy of animal tissue. Genetic engineering. Will commercial production methods involve genetic engineering? Some stakeholders expressed concern that the use of genetic engineering in cell-cultured meat production could cause the product to experience a lengthy wait for regulatory approval, similar to that for genetically engineered salmon, which took approximately 20 years. One representative from a cell-cultured meat firm noted that uncertainty about pending government regulations could negatively affect firms’ ability to attract and retain investors. Representatives from some firms said understanding what regulatory requirements will look like might influence which scientific pathways they pursue as they continue to develop their commercial production methods. According to FDA officials and representatives from one cell-cultured meat firm, it is likely that some firms will use genetic engineering in their commercial cell-cultured meat production methods. However, representatives from two other cell-cultured meat firms told us they were undecided as to whether they would use genetic engineering in their commercial production methods. Antibiotics. Will antibiotics be used to make cell-cultured meat, and will residues be present in the final product? According to agency officials, the presence of antibiotics in commercial production and the potential for residues in the resulting product would represent a significant potential concern for food safety and public health. Officials stated that they would not expect antibiotics to be used past the cell- banking phase. Representatives from cell-cultured meat firms we spoke to differed on whether they planned to use antibiotics in their commercial production process, but they had not finalized their decisions. According to one firm, if antibiotics are used, the use would be limited both in quantity and duration. Growth medium. What type of growth medium will producers use, and how might variations in the media affect the final product? According to agency officials and other stakeholders, the ingredients used in the growth medium could affect the end product’s composition and raise potential safety concerns. For example, FDA officials stated that residual growth factors, such as hormones, in the final product would be something they would likely evaluate in premarket consultations. However, representatives from cell-cultured meat firms stated that their firms have not finalized the medium they plan to use. In addition, the formulation of the medium firms use could be an important piece of intellectual property or confidential business information. Scaffold. What type of scaffold will producers use, if any, and will it be edible or inedible? The use of edible or food-grade scaffolds, where they are used, will affect the composition of the product and may need to be evaluated by federal agencies for safety. According to USDA officials, the composition of edible scaffolding may also create labeling and jurisdictional concerns. For example, USDA officials stated that the addition of edible scaffolding may require significant additional aspects of production to be subject to USDA jurisdiction. Additionally, researchers have commented that a chemical separation technique needed to separate some inedible scaffolds may also need to be evaluated for potential safety concerns. Point of harvest. How will FDA and USDA define the point of harvest? The point of harvest is the point at which FDA will transfer oversight responsibilities, including inspections, to USDA. Stakeholders have raised concerns that not having a clear definition of the point of harvest could lead to challenges such as overlapping inspection requirements or a gap in inspection. Representatives from several cell-cultured meat firms we spoke to in the spring of 2019 said it was ambiguous how FDA and USDA intended to define the point of harvest. These representatives also said it is unclear how often each agency plans to conduct inspections during the phases for which it is responsible. Agency officials stated that they are working to develop a detailed process for the transfer of jurisdiction, including defining the point of harvest. Scaling up production. How will firms scale up production to commercial levels? One 2018 study conducted by researchers in the United Kingdom stated that to produce one pound of cell-cultured meat, firms would need bioreactors at least 2 1/2 times larger than what is currently available. Similarly, a senior FDA official stated that the capacity of existing production equipment is a challenge for firms seeking to produce cell-cultured meat products at a commercial scale. As a result, the firms themselves may have to develop the equipment or custom order such equipment. Representatives from one cell- cultured meat firm told us that they are interacting with equipment providers to identify commercial-scale production equipment. Production cost. How will firms sell their product at a price point that is both profitable to the firms and affordable to the consumer? Some studies and stakeholders we interviewed, including representatives from cell-cultured meat firms, said that the high production cost of cell- cultured meat is a key industry challenge. For example, in the last two years, one firm reported that it cost $600 to make a cell-cultured meat hamburger patty and reported that it cost about $1,200 to produce a single cell-cultured meatball. One of the biggest cost drivers in the production of cell-cultured meat is the growth medium, according to some studies and some cell-cultured meat firms. To address issues of cost and scale, some firms may develop their own, less expensive growth media. Safety considerations. Are potential safety hazards in commercial production methods for cell-cultured meat different from those for conventional meat, and how will eventual commercial production methods affect the overall safety of the product? According to agency officials, cell-cultured meat may present different safety challenges compared to conventional meat. For example, according to agency officials, residues and constituents in harvested cell-cultured meat would be expected to be different from those in conventional meat, depending on the details of the production process. Representatives from one cell-cultured meat firm told us that they likely will use food processing techniques similar to those used for conventional meat, abide by similar health and safety standards, and possibly share food processing facilities. However, because specific information about commercial production methods and final products is not yet known, it is unclear whether cell-cultured meat produced on a commercial scale will pose any hazards not present in conventional meat. Product composition. What will be the composition of any eventual products? Agency officials told us that without knowing the composition of a cell-cultured meat product, it is impossible to predict how food safety and labeling requirements will apply. According to representatives from some cell-cultured meat firms, initial cell-cultured meat products most likely will not be composed entirely of cell- cultured meat but, rather, a mixture of cell-cultured meat and other ingredients such as binding, flavoring ingredients, and plant-based materials used in conventional food products. Some firms have developed prototypes of cell-cultured meat products as part of their research and development. In April 2019, representatives from one firm told us that their prototype included about 90 percent plant-based ingredients and 10 percent cell-cultured meat. However, representatives from cell-cultured meat firms stated that they aim to produce products that contain more cell-cultured meat than other ingredients. For example, some cell-cultured meat firms have stated that a long-term goal is to commercially produce cell-cultured meat products that are similar to intact cuts of meat, such as steaks. As of December 2019, these firms had not provided regulators with specific information detailing the composition of their cell-cultured meat prototypes, according to FDA and USDA officials. Environmental, animal welfare, and health impacts. How will cell- cultured meat impact the environment, animal welfare, or human health, if at all? Cell-cultured meat firms and researchers have made various claims about the potential environmental, animal welfare, and health advantages of cell-cultured meat over conventionally produced meat. For example, some cell-cultured meat firms have claimed that cell-cultured meat production would use less water and emit less greenhouse gases than conventional meat production. Some cell- cultured meat firms have also claimed that cell-cultured meat will improve animal welfare because slaughter will be unnecessary. Additionally, some stakeholders stated that because there is less opportunity for contamination from animal feces—a potential source of contamination for conventional meat—cell-cultured meat would be less likely than conventional meat to contain foodborne pathogens. However, there are disagreements regarding the accuracy of these claims. Stakeholders told us that until commercial production methods and final products are established, these claims about impacts on the environment, animal welfare, and human health will remain unsubstantiated. Timeline to market. When will cell-cultured meat products reach consumers? As of December 2019, no cell-cultured meat products were available for retail sale in the United States. Stakeholders give varying estimates for when cell-cultured meat may be commercially available. Some estimates suggest that firms may be able to commercially produce some form of cell-cultured meat product as soon as 2020, while others estimate that such products may not be available for 2 to 4 years. Labeling. How will cell-cultured meat be labeled? Labeling was an area of concern for representatives from both conventional and cell- cultured meat firms who explained that the specific terminology, such as “clean meat” or “lab-grown meat,” can sometimes reflect bias for, or against, certain products, potentially affecting consumer acceptance of these products. Additionally, stakeholders, as well as agency officials, have emphasized the importance of labeling to ensure consumers have accurate information about what they are buying. For example, in February 2018 the United States Cattlemen’s Association submitted a petition to USDA requesting that the agency limit the term “beef” to products “born, raised, and harvested in a traditional manner” and “meat” to mean the “tissue or flesh of animals that have been harvested in the traditional manner.” USDA received over 6,000 comments on the petition, and the agency had not responded to the petition as of December 2019. However, according to agency officials, USDA has committed to a public process, likely rulemaking, for the development of labeling requirements for cell- cultured meat and poultry. In addition, in recent years, a number of states have passed laws that could affect the labeling of cell-cultured meat when it comes to market. For example, in 2018, Missouri enacted a law to prohibit plant-based products and cell-cultured meat from being labeled as “meat.” Consumer Acceptance How will consumers respond to cell-cultured meat? It remains unclear whether consumers will embrace and purchase cell-cultured meat products. Stakeholders we interviewed and studies we reviewed cited consumer acceptance as a challenge for commercializing cell-cultured meat. One study noted that consumers have both positive and negative views toward cell-cultured meat, which could impact their willingness to purchase and consume such products. FDA and USDA have established multiple mechanisms to collaborate on regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat. Specifically, the agencies have collaborated through a joint public meeting, an interagency agreement, and three working groups. However, the interagency agreement and working groups, which are ongoing mechanisms, do not fully incorporate leading practices for interagency collaboration. In addition, FDA and USDA have not documented which agency will oversee cell-cultured seafood not covered by the interagency agreement. In 2018, FDA and USDA began taking steps to collaborate on the regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat through several mechanisms: a joint public meeting, an interagency agreement, and three working groups. The agencies held the joint meeting in October 2018 to discuss the use of cell-culture technology to develop products derived from livestock and poultry, and topics included potential hazards, oversight considerations, and labeling. As part of this meeting, FDA and USDA held an open public comment period from September through December 2018, gathered 315 written comments, and offered interested parties the opportunity to offer comments in person. The agencies received public comments from members of the public, as well as from representatives from cell-cultured meat and conventional meat industries, food and consumer safety groups, animal welfare groups, and environmental organizations, among others. The written comments the agencies received focused on such topics as environmental considerations, labeling, potential health and safety implications, and potential regulatory and inspection processes. Stakeholders also presented multiple perspectives on these issues at the meeting. For example, stakeholders expressed different views as to whether cell-cultured meat should be regulated as a food additive, considered a GRAS substance, or whether new regulations were needed. In March 2019, FDA and USDA issued a formal interagency agreement that describes the intended roles and responsibilities of each agency in overseeing cell-cultured meat. The agreement establishes the following: Oversight. FDA will oversee the early phases of growing cell-cultured meat through the point of harvest. During harvest, FDA will work with USDA to transfer regulatory oversight to USDA. USDA will then assume oversight of cell-cultured meat through the food processing phase, including labeling, as shown in figure 3. Types of meat covered. The agreement covers cell-cultured meat derived from species overseen by USDA, such as livestock, poultry, and catfish. Future actions. The agreement also details future actions the agencies plan to take, such as developing a more detailed regulatory framework or standard operating procedures and developing joint principles for product labeling. Reviewing and updating the agreement. The agreement states that the agencies have the ability to modify it as needed and will review the agreement every 3 years to determine whether they should modify or terminate it. In June 2019, FDA and USDA created three working groups to carry out the terms of the interagency agreement. The working groups are comprised of FDA and USDA officials and operate independently, though some individuals are members of multiple groups. The groups are as follows: Pre-market assessment working group. Led by FDA, this group was created to clarify the process FDA will use for pre-market reviews of cell-cultured meat. Labeling working group. Led by USDA, this group will focus on developing joint principles for product labeling and claims. Transfer of jurisdiction working group. Co-led by FDA and USDA, this group will develop procedures for the transfer of inspection at harvest, among other things. According to agency officials, the working groups are still in the initial phases of development, though some have progressed further than others. For example, as of December 2019, the pre-market assessment and labeling groups had met and begun to address various areas, while the transfer of jurisdiction working group was still in discussions to outline the roles, responsibilities, and outcomes for the group and had not held a formal meeting. FDA and USDA could more fully incorporate leading practices for collaboration in their interagency agreement and working groups. We have previously reported that interagency mechanisms or strategies to coordinate programs that address crosscutting issues may reduce potentially duplicative, overlapping, and fragmented efforts. In addition, while collaborative mechanisms may differ in complexity and scope, they all benefit from certain leading practices, which raise issues to consider when implementing these mechanisms. We compared the agencies’ interagency agreement and working groups with the seven leading practices to enhance and sustain interagency collaboration that we previously identified. These leading practices, and examples of the associated issues to consider, are as follows: Defining outcomes and monitoring accountability. Is there a way to track and monitor progress toward short-term and long-term outcomes? Do participating agencies have collaboration-related competencies or performance standards against which individual performance can be evaluated? Bridging organizational cultures. What are the commonalities between the participating agencies’ missions and cultures, and what are some potential challenges? Have participating agencies developed ways for operating across agency boundaries? Have participating agencies agreed on common terminology and definitions? Identifying and sustaining leadership. How will leadership be sustained over the long term? If leadership is shared, have roles and responsibilities been clearly identified and agreed upon? Clarifying roles and responsibilities. Have participating agencies clarified roles and responsibilities? Have participating agencies articulated and agreed to a process for making and enforcing decisions? Including relevant participants. Have all relevant participants been included? Do participants have appropriate knowledge, skills, and abilities to contribute? Identifying and leveraging resources. How will the collaborative mechanism be funded and staffed? Developing and updating written guidance and agreements. If appropriate, have the participating agencies documented their agreement regarding how they will collaborate? (A written document can incorporate agreements reached in any or all of the following areas: leadership, accountability, roles and responsibilities, and resources.) Have participating agencies developed ways to continually update or monitor written agreements? See appendix II for a full list of the associated issues to consider for each leading practice. We found that the interagency agreement for oversight of cell-cultured meat partially incorporates all seven leading practices for collaboration. For example: Defining outcomes and monitoring accountability. The interagency agreement partially incorporates the leading practice of defining outcomes and monitoring progress toward these outcomes. Specifically, the agreement identifies broad outcomes such as the development of labeling principles. However, the agreement does not describe how the agencies will track and monitor progress toward outcomes. Identifying and sustaining leadership. The agreement partially incorporates the leading practice of clarifying leadership structures. For example, it assigns each agency as the lead, or designates shared leadership, for different phases of the cell-cultured meat production process. However, the interagency agreement does not identify how the agencies will sustain leadership over the long term, including through succession planning. We have previously reported that given the importance of leadership to any collaborative effort, transitions and inconsistent leadership can weaken the effectiveness of any collaborative mechanism. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements. The agreement partially incorporates the leading practice of documenting how the agencies will collaborate. For example, the agreement includes a method for updating the document by including a provision that requires a review of the document every 3 years. This is consistent with our leading collaboration practice to continually update or monitor written agreements. However, the interagency agreement does not document how the agencies will track and monitor progress toward short-term and long-term outcomes. Table 1 provides more detail about the agencies’ incorporation of these leading collaboration practices in their interagency agreement. FDA and USDA officials told us that the interagency agreement was intended to be an initial, general outline for their collaboration. They also said that as the technology to produce cell-cultured meat develops and they implement the agreement, including developing the content of a regulatory program, they will consider incorporating leading practices for interagency collaboration. For example: Clarifying roles and responsibilities. FDA and USDA officials said in December 2019 that through the working groups the agencies would continue to explore and define the specific details of how they will manage their shared oversight responsibility. Including relevant participants. FDA officials said in December 2019 that the agency would like to engage many more stakeholders as it continues to develop its oversight of cell-cultured meat. Identifying and leveraging resources. As of December 2019, the pre-market assessment working group and the labeling working group were working to identify any human resources, physical, or financial resources they might need, according to FDA and USDA officials. The federal food safety system is on our High Risk List due to concerns about fragmentation, which we have reported has caused inconsistent oversight, ineffective coordination, and inefficient use of resources. As the agencies continue to collaborate on their shared oversight of cell- cultured meat, by more fully incorporating all seven leading practices for collaboration into their interagency agreement, they will be better positioned to address potential fragmentation in their efforts to ensure the safety of the food supply as cell-cultured meat products near commercialization and entry into the marketplace. We found that the pre-market assessment, labeling, and transfer of jurisdiction working groups that FDA and USDA created to carry out the terms of the interagency agreement either partially incorporate or do not incorporate the seven leading practices for interagency collaboration. Specifically, all three working groups have partially incorporated three of the seven leading practices for collaboration, but none of the working groups have incorporated the four remaining leading practices. For example: Defining outcomes and monitoring accountability. The working groups have all defined and agreed upon their general purposes. However, FDA and USDA have not established methods, such as milestones and metrics, to evaluate the progress of any of the working groups. For example, FDA officials said in December 2019 that their next steps are to conduct a general and qualitative risk assessment of animal cell culture food technology to systematically identify particular areas of interest from a food safety perspective and prepare detailed procedural guidelines for cell-cultured meat firms to follow. However, the officials did not have time frames or a method to evaluate progress towards completing these actions. Including relevant participants. While the working groups have included relevant FDA and USDA officials, none of the groups have included state or tribal officials in initial discussions and planning. According to the state officials we spoke with, being excluded from these federal-level discussions may hinder their ability to align their safety and labeling requirements, among other things, with federal standards. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements. None of the working groups have documented how they will collaborate. For example, the working groups have not documented leadership, accountability, roles and responsibilities, or resources needed for working groups. Table 2 provides more detail about FDA and USDA’s incorporation of leading collaboration practices in the three working groups. In December 2019, FDA and USDA officials said that as they continued to stand up these working groups, they were considering leading practices for collaboration. For example: Defining outcomes and monitoring accountability. FDA and USDA officials said they were considering means to monitor, evaluate, or report on the results of the pre-market assessment working group. Including relevant participants. FDA and USDA officials said that they were working to determine what knowledge participants in the pre-market assessment working group and the labeling working group needed to perform the work of the working group. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements. FDA and USDA officials said they were considering documenting how they will collaborate in the pre-market assessment working group, including potentially creating a charter for the working group. We have previously reported that fragmentation has caused inconsistent oversight and inefficient use of resources in the federal food safety oversight system. The agencies’ 2019 agreement to share oversight of cell-cultured meat creates a new relationship between FDA and USDA, since the agencies will oversee different stages of the production of the same food and hand off oversight at a certain point in that production. These factors contribute to an already complicated system in which the two agencies must coordinate on food safety oversight. In this context, some industry representatives and other stakeholders have expressed concerns about potential fragmentation or overlap in oversight of cell-cultured meat, such as could occur during the harvest phase of cell-cultured meat production when FDA hands off its oversight to USDA. Additionally, representatives from one cell-cultured meat firm stated that avoiding overlap in federal oversight whenever possible was important to them. For example, representatives from one firm pointed to inspection, record-keeping requirements, and regulations as potential areas at risk of overlap. They stated that potential overlap would add unnecessary, burdensome requirements and create an uneven playing field with the conventional meat industry. By more fully incorporating all seven leading practices for interagency collaboration early in the development of the three working groups, FDA and USDA could proactively minimize potential fragmentation and overlap in their oversight of cell-cultured meat, ensure consistency and efficient use of resources, and provide clarity to key stakeholders. While FDA and USDA officials told us they have decided who will oversee cell-cultured seafood, they have not formally announced or documented this decision, and some stakeholders have reported confusion or ambiguity about which agency will oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish. Specifically, FDA and USDA’s interagency agreement regarding cell-cultured meat states that it covers all cell-cultured meat derived from USDA-amenable species required to bear a USDA mark of inspection, which in the agreement includes livestock, poultry, and catfish. However, the agreement does not mention cell-cultured meat made from the cells of other fish, such as tuna and shellfish. FDA and USDA officials told us that FDA will have sole oversight responsibility for cell-cultured seafood other than catfish. According to FDA officials, they have verbally communicated this decision in various meetings with stakeholders. However, FDA and USDA officials told us that formally documenting FDA’s sole oversight of most cell- cultured seafood in their interagency agreement was unnecessary because FDA currently oversees most conventional seafood. According to cell-cultured meat firms, some firms are working on developing cell- cultured versions of seafood, such as bluefin tuna. However, stakeholders from two cell-cultured meat firms, including representatives of a cell- cultured seafood firm we spoke with in April 2019, stated that they did not know who in the federal government would oversee cell-cultured seafood. Representatives from one cell-cultured seafood firm said that not being able to rule out oversight by USDA prevented them from making key decisions regarding what direction to pursue in developing their commercial production method. While FDA and USDA officials told us they had agreed that FDA would oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish, as of December 2019, the agencies had not formally announced or documented this agreement. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements is a leading practice for collaboration, as we have previously reported. In addition, standards for internal control in the federal government state that agency management should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve its objectives and should select appropriate methods of communication, such as a written document or a face-to-face meeting. Management should also periodically evaluate the entity’s methods of communication so that the organization has the appropriate tools to communicate quality information throughout and outside of the entity on a timely basis. While FDA and USDA officials have informally communicated to some stakeholders that FDA will have sole oversight of most cell-cultured seafood, FDA has not communicated this information formally or in a method readily available to all relevant stakeholders, such as in their interagency agreement or other publicly available written document. FDA and USDA officials told us that they wanted to communicate this information through outreach to individual firms, but FDA or USDA officials said they did not think that revising their interagency agreement was necessary. By taking steps to document which agency will oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish, FDA and USDA will better ensure the public, including key stakeholders such as cell-cultured meat firms, have clarity about the agencies’ oversight responsibilities in this area. Cell-cultured meat is a new food product that raises many questions. FDA and USDA’s shared oversight of cell-cultured meat poses various challenges for these agencies, as well as stakeholders such as industry. Compounding this challenge is that specific information about key aspects of cell-cultured meat, such as the technology and production methods to be used as well as the composition of the products, is not yet known. FDA and USDA have taken steps to collaborate on their shared regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat, including establishing an interagency agreement and three working groups. However, the interagency agreement only partially incorporates the seven leading collaboration practices that can enhance and sustain agencies’ collaborative efforts, and the working groups either partially incorporate or do not incorporate these leading practices, which has raised concerns about potential fragmentation or overlap in oversight. By more fully incorporating all seven leading practices for collaboration into their interagency agreement, FDA and USDA could build on their existing efforts and be better positioned to sustain and enhance their collaborative efforts. Moreover, by more fully incorporating all seven leading practices for interagency collaboration early in the development of the working groups, FDA and USDA could proactively minimize potential fragmentation and overlap in their oversight of cell-cultured meat and ensure they are utilizing resources efficiently or effectively. Furthermore, the interagency agreement states that it covers USDA- amenable species required to bear a USDA mark of inspection, which in the agreement includes livestock, poultry, and catfish but does not include cell-cultured seafood other than catfish. FDA and USDA officials told us they have decided FDA will oversee most cell-cultured seafood, but the agencies have not formally documented this decision. By taking steps to document in their interagency agreement, or other publicly available document, which agency will oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish, FDA and USDA could better ensure that members of the public and other key stakeholders such as cell-cultured meat firms have clarity about the agencies’ oversight responsibilities in this area. We are making a total of six recommendations, three to FDA and three to USDA: The Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, should more fully incorporate the seven leading practices for effective collaboration in the agencies’ interagency agreement for the joint oversight of cell-cultured meat. (Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination with the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, should more fully incorporate the seven leading practices for effective collaboration in the agencies’ interagency agreement for the joint oversight of cell-cultured meat. (Recommendation 2) As the three cell-cultured meat working groups move forward, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, should more fully incorporate the seven leading practices for effective collaboration, such as identifying specific outcomes and a way to monitor and evaluate progress toward outcomes. (Recommendation 3) As the three cell-cultured meat working groups move forward, the Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination with the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, should more fully incorporate the seven leading practices for effective collaboration, such as identifying specific outcomes and a way to monitor and evaluate progress toward outcomes. (Recommendation 4) The Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, should clearly document in their interagency agreement, or other publicly available document, which agency will oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish. (Recommendation 5) The Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination with the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, should clearly document in their interagency agreement, or other publicly available document, which agency will oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish. (Recommendation 6) We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for review and comment. In FDA’s comments, reproduced in appendix III, the agency stated that it values GAO’s recognition of the importance of collaborative mechanisms that facilitate coordination and affirmed its commitment to coordinate closely with USDA to ensure the regulatory framework for cell-cultured meat is clear and transparent to stakeholders. In USDA’s comments, reproduced in appendix IV, the department stated that the report put too much focus on best practices for interagency collaboration and not enough emphasis on industry’s role in providing the agencies with the information they need to move their processes forward to effectively regulate cell-cultured meat. USDA stated that it is difficult to review a developing technology and its future regulatory oversight when so little detailed information about the technology is known. We agree that the technology to produce cell-cultured meat is still in development and that information about the commercial production methods and composition of the final product are not yet known, as we state in our report. We also acknowledge in our report that having limited information can affect the agencies’ ability to make regulatory and other decisions. We recognize that cell-cultured meat is a new food product that raises many new questions and that specific information about key aspects of cell-cultured meat is not yet known. In light of this challenging context, it is all the more important that FDA and USDA more fully incorporate leading practices for collaboration into their joint efforts in order to ensure they are in the best possible position to oversee this new food product. FDA concurred with two recommendations and partially concurred with one. USDA also concurred with two recommendations and partially concurred with one. Specifically, both agencies agreed with our recommendations regarding (1) more fully incorporating the seven leading practices for effective collaboration in the three cell-cultured meat working groups as they move forward and (2) clearly documenting which agency will oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish. FDA and USDA partially concurred with our recommendation, directed to each agency, to more fully incorporate the seven leading practices for effective collaboration into the agencies’ interagency agreement for the joint oversight of cell-cultured meat. FDA stated that it concurred with the intent of incorporating the seven leading practices into the interagency agreement, and both agencies said that they are open to incorporating the practices into their development of the structure for joint oversight of cell-cultured meat. However, the agencies stated that they did not agree to revise the agreement at this time. FDA and USDA stated that the agreement is a general framework and that incorporating the leading practices would constitute an inappropriate level of detail. Instead, the agencies stated that they believe it would be most valuable to incorporate the leading practices into a more detailed joint framework or standard operating procedure they plan to issue. We appreciate the agencies’ willingness to incorporate the leading practices for effective collaboration into their efforts. The March 2019 interagency agreement states that the agencies have the ability to modify it as needed and will review the agreement every 3 years to determine whether they should modify or terminate it. Therefore, the agencies are due to revisit the agreement in March 2022, if not sooner. Regarding the agencies’ concern that incorporating the leading practices in the interagency agreement would add an inappropriate level of detail, we note that, as we state in our report, the existing agreement already partially incorporates each of the seven leading practices. We continue to believe that FDA and USDA should more fully incorporate the seven leading practices for effective collaboration into their interagency agreement for the joint oversight of cell-cultured meat. Developing a more detailed joint framework or standard operating procedure in accordance with the existing interagency agreement that incorporates those leading practices would meet the intent of our recommendation to improve the effectiveness of the agencies’ collaboration. FDA and USDA also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its issue date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Agriculture, and other interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff members have any questions regarding this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3841 or morriss@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. Our report (1) describes what is known about methods for commercially producing cell-cultured meat and (2) examines the extent to which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) are collaborating to provide regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat. For both objectives, we conducted a literature review of journal and media articles from 2016 through 2019 to inform our understanding of cell- cultured meat, as well as regulatory activity related to cell-cultured meat in the United States and in other countries. Specifically, we conducted a review of scholarly and trade news from 2016 through July 2019 for specific terms related to cell-cultured meat and regulatory approaches. We conducted searches in more than 30 different academic and trade databases—such as SCOPUS, Foodline, and ProQuest’s Environmental Science Collection—and identified studies relevant to our research objectives. In addition to these formal literature searches, we also asked agency officials and stakeholders to refer us to research articles and publications on cell-cultured meat. We also reviewed documentation from FDA and USDA, including the 2019 interagency agreement, existing memoranda of understanding between the two agencies, Federal Register notices about relevant public meetings, and press releases. We also reviewed documentation such as letters to regulators, presentation slides, and information on organizations’ websites from the cell-cultured meat industry, conventional meat industry, and consumer safety groups, among others. We also interviewed officials from FDA and USDA and representatives of stakeholders from the cell-cultured meat industry and industry associations, conventional meat firms and industry associations, academia, food and consumer safety groups, and state and tribal public health associations, among others. We identified stakeholders to interview through consultation with agency officials and nonfederal stakeholders and through our review of literature. We conducted 17 interviews with representatives or researchers from: six cell-cultured meat firms or industry associations, four conventional meat firms or industry associations, two food and consumer safety groups, one state and tribal public health association, and one food law policy firm. Because this is a nongeneralizable sample, the results of these interviews do not represent the views of all stakeholders involved in or with an interest in the cell-cultured or conventional meat industries or federal regulation of cell-cultured meat. However, they illustrate the range of perspectives on these topics. We also attended public meetings and conferences and conducted site visits to several locations. Specifically, we attended FDA and USDA’s public meeting in October 2018 and four conferences in 2019 that included content pertaining to food safety or cell-cultured meat. We conducted site visits to two conventional meat-processing facilities in Georgia, three cell-cultured meat firms in California, an academic cell- culturing laboratory in California, and a medical cell-culturing facility in Maryland. We identified facilities and laboratories to visit through our literature review, online research, and the assistance of agency officials and stakeholders, such as representatives from the cell-cultured meat and conventional meat industry. To describe what is known about the process for producing cell-cultured meat and potential commercial production methods, we also reviewed two sets of public comments submitted to FDA and USDA in association with the two 2018 public meetings pertaining to cell-cultured meat. These meetings were “Foods Produced Using Animal Cell Culture Technology” in July 2018 and “Use of Cell Culture Technology to Develop Products Derived from Livestock and Poultry” in October 2018. Public comments were submitted by members of the public; representatives from cell- cultured meat firms and industry associations, conventional meat companies and industry associations, food and consumer safety groups, and animal welfare groups; and environmental organizations, among others. We reviewed and analyzed all comments submitted to (1) FDA related to the July 2018 meeting and (2) FDA and USDA related to the October 2018 meeting. We also attended the October 2018 meeting and listened to agency officials’ presentations and oral remarks made by stakeholders and members of the public. We shared our description of the process for making cell-cultured meat, and associated questions, with representatives from three cell-cultured meat firms and academic researchers at two universities for their technical review and incorporated revisions as appropriate. To examine the extent to which FDA and USDA are coordinating to provide regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat, we identified actions they took to coordinate from July 2018 through April 2020. To identify these actions, we interviewed agency officials, emailed agency officials written questions, reviewed agency documentation and public announcements, and attended public events such as the October 2018 public meeting. We compared the agencies’ interagency agreement and working groups with seven leading practices to enhance and sustain interagency collaboration. Specifically, two independent GAO reviewers assessed the degree to which agencies’ actions incorporated these leading practices. A description of these leading practices and the associated issues to consider is in appendix II. We also assessed the agencies’ actions against standards for internal control in the federal government, including standards related to communicating quality information. In this report, and in our past work, we define collaboration as any joint activity that is intended to produce more public value than could be produced when organizations act alone. We use the terms “coordination” and “collaboration” interchangeably in this report. For the purposes of our report, we define cell-cultured meat as food derived from animal cells that were grown in a controlled environment outside of the animal. We define cell-cultured seafood as a subcategory of cell-cultured meat. When referencing conventional meat, we are referring to food produced from the traditional method of slaughtering an animal, such as a cow, hog, chicken, or fish. When referencing seafood, we are referring to shellfish, sea fish, and freshwater fish served as food. We conducted this performance audit from October 2018 to April 2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

For example, one purpose of FACA is to ensure that uniform procedures govern the establishment and operation of advisory committees. Also under FACA, an agency establishing an advisory committee must, among other things, require the committee’s membership to be balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the committee. In addition, federal ethics regulations establish when and how federal officials should review financial disclosure forms to identify and prevent conflicts of interest prohibited by federal law for any prospective committee members required to file these forms in connection with their appointments to advisory committees. GSA has provided additional guidance regarding the implementation of ethics requirements under FACA. Various EPA offices and officials are responsible for helping the agency follow these requirements. For example, EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee Management Division—which has overall responsibility for committee management and ensuring that EPA’s advisory committees comply with FACA—developed the Federal Advisory Committee Handbook to clarify roles and responsibilities for complying with relevant requirements. The handbook was written primarily for EPA employees assigned as designated federal officers for committees. These officers are responsible for the day-to-day management of advisory committees and play a central role in identifying and recommending candidates who can help the committees meet their goals. EPA employees assigned as designated federal officers also are responsible for maintaining committee records. According to EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee Handbook, one of the primary reasons that Congress passed FACA was to ensure public access to the records and documents of advisory committees, and that this fosters greater transparency and accountability of agencies’ use of advisory committees. EPA’s Ethics Office is responsible for helping the agency follow federal ethics requirements. Housed within the agency’s Office of General Counsel in headquarters, the Ethics Office oversees all aspects of the agency’s ethics program, including financial disclosure reporting. The Designated Agency Ethics Official coordinates and manages the program. The Designated Agency Ethics Official delegates authority to more than 100 deputy ethics officials located throughout the agency— including in headquarters and regional offices—to carry out most elements of EPA’s ethics program. For example, deputy ethics officials are to review financial disclosure reports for prospective committee members to identify and prevent conflicts of interest. Deputy assistant administrators, deputy regional administrators, office directors, and other EPA managers may be appointed to serve as deputy ethics officials for their offices as ancillary duties to their other responsibilities. EPA can establish two kinds of advisory committees—non-discretionary and discretionary committees. The agency establishes non- discretionary committees when required to by statute or directed to by the President. For example, the Clean Air Act requires EPA to establish an advisory committee to, among other things, help EPA review standards for national ambient air quality every 5 years. EPA also can establish discretionary committees at the Administrator’s direction if, for example, these committees provide an important and unique perspective on EPA programs or operations. An example of a discretionary committee is the Pesticide Program Dialogue Committee, which was formed to help EPA perform its duties under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and related laws. See appendix II for a list of EPA’s 22 advisory committees as of March 31, 2018. EPA must approve the establishment of any subcommittees formed to assist committees with their work. EPA also can appoint different types of members to its advisory committees, depending on the needs of its committees and other considerations. For instance, EPA may appoint a committee member as a federal government employee under an appropriate hiring authority. If EPA expects a federal employee to serve no more than 130 days in any 365-day period, guidance from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics (OGE), which oversees the executive branch’s ethics program, states that the employee should be designated as a special government employee (SGE). If EPA decides not to appoint the committee member as a federal employee, that committee member would be a non-employee representative. EPA decides whether to appoint committee members as federal employees. To help federal agencies such as EPA determine whether to designate committee members as SGEs or representatives, OGE has developed guidance on factors to consider when agencies make these determinations. For example, OGE guidance states that SGEs are expected to provide independent expert advice and provide their best judgment free from conflicts of interest. They are generally subject to federal ethics regulations placed on other federal employees—including the requirement to file financial disclosure forms. In addition, OGE guidance states that representatives serve as the voice of groups or entities with a financial or other stake in a particular matter before an advisory committee. Federal ethics regulations generally do not apply to representative members on FACA committees. GSA has certain government-wide responsibilities for implementing FACA, including maintaining the government-wide FACA database that tracks certain characteristics of advisory committees. Specifically, FACA requires GSA to comprehensively review the activities and responsibilities of each advisory committee annually, including the committees for which EPA officials are responsible. In turn, GSA requires federal agencies responsible for advisory committees to enter data about those committees into the database. GSA and the responsible agency (e.g., EPA) review the data on a fiscal year basis for accuracy and completeness. These reviews are typically completed by February or March of the following year. GSA’s database is accessible by the general public. It includes data on committee members and committee activities from more than 50 agencies going back to 1997. The information on EPA committees includes: whether a committee member is designated as an SGE or representative; the occupation or affiliation of a committee member; state or other geographic information associated with a committee member’s occupation or affiliation; the appointment’s start and end date for each committee member; and the dates that committees held meetings. Based on our review of EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee Handbook, the agency’s established process for appointing advisory committee members includes three main phases. These phases are soliciting nominations, evaluating candidates, and obtaining approvals from relevant EPA offices, such as the Federal Advisory Committee Management Division, before the Administrator or Deputy Administrator makes final appointment decisions. As shown in figure 1, each of the three main phases in EPA’s process involves several smaller steps. Unless noted otherwise, explanations of these steps can be found in the handbook, which documents the agency’s established process. Soliciting nominations involves six basic steps, which are carried out by a committee’s designated federal officer. The steps are as follows: Develop selection criteria. This step involves identifying the specific perspectives or points of view that should be represented by members on the committee, such as specific scientific perspectives or understandings of environmental justice. This step applies to both discretionary and non-discretionary committees. In addition, federal laws establish membership requirements for the agency’s non- discretionary committees that designated federal officers must consider when developing selection criteria. For example, the Clean Air Act requires EPA to appoint seven members—including at least one member of the National Academy of Sciences, one physician, and one person representing state air-pollution control agencies—to an independent scientific advisory committee, known as CASAC. The selection criteria developed in this step should be reflected in the notice soliciting nominations. Develop an outreach plan. This plan should: (1) describe in detail how committees intend to solicit a diverse set of nominees and (2) discuss the specific forms of solicitation. For example, one outreach plan we reviewed specified that EPA staff would solicit nominations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, American Chemical Society, and other organizations that can help EPA review the quality, relevance, and performance of its research programs. Develop membership balance plans for discretionary committees. GSA guidance states that membership balance plans for discretionary committees should describe the process used to ensure that committee membership is balanced in terms of the points of view represented and functions to be performed by the committee. For example, one membership balance plan we reviewed stated that EPA staff would consider candidates from farm worker organizations; pesticide industry and trade associations; state, local and tribal governments; and public health and other organizations. According to that membership balance plan, EPA staff also would consider prospective committee members’ geographic location to help achieve balanced membership. Solicit nominations. During this step, the designated federal officer can solicit nominations via Federal Register notices and other means, such as emails to professional associations and specific EPA email distribution lists. In response to these notices, organizations can nominate individuals, or individuals can nominate themselves or other individuals. Contact nominees after receiving nominations. During this step, the designated federal officer confirms nominees’ qualifications and experience as well as their interest in and availability to serve on the committee. Assess the diversity of the pool of nominees and conduct additional outreach, if needed, to increase the diversity of the pool. EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee Handbook provides illustrative examples of how to follow this step. In one example, the handbook explains that a committee needs a representative from local government. For the past several years, the position has been filled by someone from an affluent suburban county. To increase diversity, the handbook recommends that the designated federal officer broaden outreach to other parts of the country, especially local governments that serve low-income, rural, urban, medically underserved, or vulnerable populations. Evaluating candidates similarly involves several steps. The committee’s designated federal officer is primarily responsible for taking these steps for his or her assigned committee. In addition, a deputy ethics official is to review financial disclosure forms for any prospective members who are required to file these forms. In general, the steps for evaluating candidates are as follows: Evaluate candidates against selection criteria. During this step, the designated federal officer identifies the specific point of view that each candidate would bring to the committee—as well as each candidate’s ability to meet the selection criteria after interviewing candidates and reviewing their curriculum vitae, publications, and other relevant information. EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee Handbook notes that having the best people who represent key interests and balanced viewpoints enables the committee to provide EPA with recommendations that the agency can rely on as collective advice representing diverse stakeholder views. Identifying the best candidates may involve reviewing many more nominees than can be appointed. For example, EPA received approximately 100 nominations for 18 positions on the Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals in fiscal year 2017. Prepare a draft membership grid document with staff- recommended candidates and alternates. After evaluating individual candidates, the handbook directs the designated federal officer to recommend at least one primary and alternate candidate for each point of view and consolidate his or her short-list of recommended candidates into a draft membership grid document. The handbook indicates that this is a key step in the agency’s appointment process. It is intended to help designated federal officers identify gaps as they seek to meet FACA requirements for balanced committee membership. The handbook also directs the designated federal officer to submit the draft membership grid to EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee Management Division, EPA’s Office of General Counsel, and the Assistant Administrator for review and approval before submitting final recommendations to the Administrator. Therefore, the draft membership grid, which documents EPA staff’s rationale for recommending specific candidates, is intended to serve as the basis for discussions with EPA management as final decisions about the committee’s composition are made, according to EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee Handbook. Recommending at least one alternate for each point of view is intended to provide the EPA Administrator or Deputy Administrator—who officially selects committee members based on staff recommendations—with flexibility in appointing members, according to the handbook. Review financial disclosure forms for conformance with applicable conflict-of-interest statutes, regulations issued by OGE including any supplemental agency requirements, and other federal ethics rules, which state, among other things, that: SGEs appointed to serve on federal advisory committees generally must file financial disclosure forms within 30 days of assuming their new positions and either before providing advice to the agency or before the first committee meeting if they are eligible to file confidentially. The designated ethics official from each executive branch agency generally is to review financial disclosure reports within 60 days after receiving them and is to certify by signature and date that the filer is in compliance with federal ethics rules, and this official generally may delegate this responsibility. Obtaining approvals involves several steps and numerous EPA officials. The steps for obtaining approvals generally are as follows: EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee Management Division reviews the proposed membership for balance. EPA guidance states that designated federal officers are to obtain written concurrence from the division before preparing the final membership package for the Administrator to sign. EPA’s Office of General Counsel conducts a legal review of the proposed membership. EPA guidance states that designated federal officers are to obtain written concurrence from the Office of General Counsel prior to appointment. Assistant Administrator or Regional Administrator approves the list of recommended candidates that will be presented to the Administrator’s office. Administrator or Deputy Administrator makes final appointment decisions and signs appointment letters. From fiscal year 2017 through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2018, EPA generally followed its established process for most advisory committees; however, in fiscal year 2018, EPA did not follow a key step in its process for appointing 20 committee members to the SAB and CASAC. SAB is the agency’s largest committee and CASAC is responsible for, among other things, reviewing national ambient air-quality standards. In addition, when reviewing the step in EPA’s appointment process related specifically to financial disclosure reporting, we found that EPA did not consistently ensure that SGEs appointed to advisory committees met federal financial disclosure requirements. Our review of agency documents that supported appointment decisions for the 17 committees that appointed or reappointed committee members from fiscal year 2017 through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2018 found that EPA generally followed its process for most committees. All 14 of the discretionary committees that appointed or reappointed members during this time period developed membership balance plans, as required by GSA’s FACA regulations. In addition, 15 committees followed the step in EPA’s appointment process related to draft membership grid documents. That is, 20 of the 22 appointment packets we reviewed had draft membership grid documents reflecting EPA staff input on the best qualified and most appropriate candidates for achieving balanced committee membership. Additionally, 21 of the 22 appointment packets we reviewed contained documentation showing that EPA’s Office of General Counsel reviewed the proposed membership prior to appointment, as recommended by EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee Handbook. Figure 2 shows EPA’s established process and the steps we reviewed. For additional information about the extent to which EPA followed its process for appointing committee members, see appendix III. However, EPA did not follow a key step in its established process for appointing 20 members in fiscal year 2018 to the SAB and CASAC, which advise the agency on environmental regulatory matters, among other things. Specifically, the fiscal year 2018 appointment packets for the SAB and CASAC did not include draft membership grid documents reflecting EPA staff rationales for recommending the candidates EPA’s staff deem best qualified and most appropriate for achieving balanced committee membership. EPA officials told us in March 2019 that they did not prepare draft membership grids, as recommended by EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee Handbook, because EPA management requested a series of briefings instead. EPA officials also told us that during these briefings, EPA staff presented options for management to consider that reflected staff evaluations and summaries of public comments on candidates. EPA management then decided whom to appoint after reviewing the entire list of personnel nominated for membership—not a short-list of staff-recommended candidates, as called for by EPA’s handbook. During previous appointment cycles, EPA documents indicate and officials told us that EPA followed its established process when appointing committee members to SAB and CASAC. Specifically, documents from SAB’s and CASAC’s fiscal year 2017 appointment cycles indicate that both committees prepared draft membership grids in fiscal year 2017 in accordance with EPA’s established process. In addition, SAB and CASAC staff we interviewed told us that the process they used for filling vacancies prior to the fiscal year 2018 appointments involved vetting candidates before documenting in draft membership grids the candidates they deemed best qualified and most appropriate for achieving balanced committees. EPA officials stated that the briefing process they used in fiscal year 2018 was considered better than the use of draft membership grids, as it allowed EPA management to have in-depth discussions with SAB staff, resulting in better knowledge and a greater understanding of the SAB’s and CASAC’s membership needs. In written comments on the draft report, EPA stated that the vetting of candidates for SAB and CASAC occurred in a different manner than in previous years with a process more robust than membership grids. In addition, EPA stated that the public comment process was more robust, going beyond what was prescribed in the traditional membership process. There may be benefits to such discussions and solicitation of input. However, under EPA’s established process, agency staff are to document in draft membership grids and include in appointment packets their rationales for recommending the candidates they deem best qualified and most appropriate for achieving balanced committees. EPA developed guidance to implement FACA, one purpose of which is to encourage the establishment of uniform committee appointment and administration procedures. In written comments on the draft report, EPA noted that agency staff documented evaluations of advisory committee candidates in briefing documents. However, EPA did not provide these documents along with its comments. Moreover, neither these evaluations nor summaries of public comments were included in the packets that EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee Handbook indicates are to contain committee appointment information, impeding EPA’s ability to ensure that it consistently meets—across all of its advisory committees—FACA’s purpose of encouraging uniform committee appointment procedures. In addition, Federal Standards for Internal Control call for management to design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, such as by clearly documenting all transactions and other significant events in a manner that allows the documentation to be readily available for examination. By directing officials responsible for appointing committee members to follow a key step in EPA’s appointment process—developing draft membership grids to document staff rationales for proposed membership—the agency would also have better assurance that it could show how it made appointment decisions to achieve the best qualified and most appropriate candidates for balanced membership. When reviewing the steps in EPA’s appointment process related specifically to financial disclosure reporting, we found that from fiscal year 2017 through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2018, EPA did not consistently ensure that 74 SGEs appointed or reappointed to serve on EPA advisory committees met federal financial-disclosure requirements. Of the 74 disclosure forms we reviewed, an ethics official signed and dated that the filer was in compliance with federal ethics rules for 77 percent, or 57 of the forms. However, for about 23 percent, or 17 of the 74 financial disclosure forms we reviewed, an ethics official had not signed and dated that the filer was in compliance with federal ethics rules. In addition, for about 57 percent, or 42 of the 74 forms we reviewed, we were unable to determine whether an ethics official had reviewed the financial disclosure forms within 60 days after they were filed because the forms did not indicate when EPA had received them. Table 1 illustrates the extent to which EPA took steps to ensure compliance with federal financial-disclosure-reporting requirements relevant to SGEs during this time period. In 2017, OGE found similar weaknesses in EPA’s ethics program. For example, when OGE reviewed a sample of EPA advisory committees’ ethics documents from 2015, it found that none of the financial disclosure forms for one committee had been reviewed—or signed and dated—by an ethics official to indicate that filers were in conformance with federal ethics rules. For two other committees, OGE found that EPA had not received in 2015 certain financial-disclosure forms that were due that year. We also found that EPA’s Ethics Office had not periodically evaluated, through audits or spot-checks, the quality of financial disclosure reviews conducted by its deputy ethics officials for SGEs appointed to advisory committees, as part of the periodic review of its ethics program called for by OGE regulations. An official we interviewed from EPA’s Ethics Office told us that the office did not have the staffing levels necessary to audit or spot-check financial disclosure reviews for SGEs. In addition, in a June 2018 correspondence to OGE about OGE’s review of EPA’s ethics program, EPA’s Designated Agency Ethics Official stated that EPA’s Ethics Office had fewer than three full-time equivalent positions at times during 2017. The correspondence also stated that the agency’s Office of General Counsel is committed to doubling the Ethics Office’s staffing levels in the future to increase oversight of its deputy ethics officials. Federal regulations and guidance specify that EPA has certain oversight responsibilities for its programs—including its ethics program. For example, OGE regulations: state that designated agency ethics officials, acting directly or through other officials, are responsible for carrying out effective financial disclosure programs by, among other things, using information in financial disclosure reports to prevent and resolve potential conflicts of interest; specify actions the official must take if the reviewing official concludes that information disclosed in the report may reveal a violation of applicable laws and regulations; and state that designated agency ethics officials are responsible for periodically evaluating their agencies’ ethics programs. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government also states that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, such as by comparing actual performance to planned or expected results and analyzing significant differences. Because EPA had not periodically evaluated through audits or spot- checks the quality of financial disclosure reviews for SGEs appointed to advisory committees, the agency was not well positioned to compare the program’s actual performance with planned results or address instances of noncompliance with federal ethics requirements. Until EPA’s Ethics Office, as part of its periodic review of its ethics program, evaluates—for example, through audits or spot-checks—the quality of financial disclosure reviews conducted for SGEs appointed to EPA advisory committees, it will not have reasonable assurance that it is addressing noncompliance with federal ethics requirements and preventing conflicts of interest among SGEs appointed to EPA advisory committees. EPA officials acknowledged that taking this additional oversight measure could enhance the agency’s ethics program. Of the four characteristics we reviewed—committee composition, regional affiliation, membership turnover, and number of committee meetings— one or more of the first three characteristics changed notably for four of 18 of EPA’s advisory committees after January 2017. There were no notable changes in the four characteristics we reviewed for the other 14 committees for which we reviewed at least one of the characteristics. The committee composition, regional affiliation, or membership turnover of four of EPA’s advisory committees changed notably after January 2017 compared to the period after January 2009. There was no notable change in the fourth characteristic we reviewed—that is, the number of meetings committees held. Each change identified as notable had at least a 20 percentage point difference in the change to the characteristic after January 2017 compared to the period after January 2009. See appendix I for additional information about our methodology. There was a notable decrease in the percentage of members affiliated with academic institutions on the SAB and EPA Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC) committees after January 2017 compared to the period after January 2009. Our analysis shows that the percentage of committee members with an academic affiliation serving on the SAB decreased by 27 percentage points, or from 77 percent (36 of 47 members) on January 19, 2017, to 50 percent (22 of 44 members) about 15 months later on March 31, 2018. There was little change in the period after January 2009, when the percentage of academic members serving on the SAB remained stable at 83 percent (33 of 40 members) on January 19, 2009, and 82 percent (32 of 39 members) about 15 months later on March 31, 2010. Regarding 2013, academic members serving on the SAB decreased from 82 percent (40 of 49 members) on January 20, 2013 to 73 percent (37 of 51 members) about 15 months later. In addition to academic members, other members serving on the SAB are (1) affiliated with government (federal, local, state, or tribal) or with industry or non-government organizations (NGO); (2) are consultants; or (3) are others we could not assign to one of the above categories. See figure 3. BOSC also experienced a notable decrease in the percentage of members with an academic affiliation serving on the committee after January 2017 compared to the period after January 2009. Our analysis shows that the percentage of committee members with an academic affiliation serving on BOSC decreased by 45 percentage points, or from 65 percent (11 of 17 members) on January 19, 2017, to 20 percent (3 of 15 members) about 15 months later on March 31, 2018. There was little change in the percentage of academic members serving on BOSC after either January 2009 or January 2013. The percentage of members with an academic affiliation serving on BOSC was 55 percent (6 of 11 members) on January 19, 2009, and 56 percent (5 of 9 members) about 15 months later on March 31, 2010. Seven of 12 members were affiliated with academic institutions on January 20, 2013, and 5 of 9 members were similarly affiliated about 15 months later. See table 2. The regional affiliation of SAB committee members also changed notably after January 2017 compared to the period after January 2009. Our analysis shows that members affiliated with the southern region—which spans from Texas to Delaware—increased by about 25 percentage points, or from 28 percent (13 of 47 members) on January 19, 2017, to 52 percent (23 of 44 members) about 15 months later on March 31, 2018. There was little change in the period after January 2009, when the percentage of members affiliated with the southern region increased from 30 percent (12 of 40 members) on January 19, 2009, to 33 percent (13 of 39 members) about 15 months later on March 31, 2009. Regarding 2013, members affiliated with the southern region decreased from 33 percent (16 of 49 members) on January 20, 2013, to 27 percent (14 of 51 members) about 15 months later. Figure 4 shows the regional affiliation of SAB members using U.S. Census regions after January 2017 and January 2009. There was also a notable change in the number of members who left three committees after January 2017 compared to the number of members who left those committees after January 2009. Our analysis shows that of the members serving on January 19, 2017, 71 percent (12 of 17 members) of BOSC, 62 percent (23 of 37 members) of the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee, and 63 percent (25 of 40 members) of the Pesticide Program Dialogue Committee were no longer serving about 15 months later on March 31, 2018. There was little change in the period after January 2009, when 18 percent (2 of 11 members) of the members of BOSC and 3 percent (one of 35 members) of the members serving on the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee on January 19, 2009, were no longer serving on the committees about 15 months later on March 31, 2010. All of the members serving on the Pesticide Program Dialogue Committee (34 members) on January 19, 2009, were also serving about 15 months later on March 31, 2010. Regarding 2013, 25 percent (3 of 12 members) serving on BOSC on January 20, 2013, were not serving about 15 months later. All members serving on the other two committees on January 20, 2013, were also serving about 15 months later. In most instances, the four characteristics that we analyzed—committee composition, regional affiliation, membership turnover, and number of committee meetings held—did not change notably for the committees we reviewed from January 2017 to about 15 months later compared to the same time frame after January 2009. In many of these instances, the characteristics we analyzed had changed, but these changes were not large enough to be considered notable based on the approach we used to identify notable changes. Other than the SAB and BOSC, there were no notable changes after January 2017 in the composition of the five committees for which we analyzed this characteristic. We analyzed the committee composition of the three other committees combined because they did not have enough members to make individual analysis meaningful. Our analysis shows that the largest change after January 2017 that we did not identify as notable also occurred with BOSC. The percentage of members serving on BOSC with a government affiliation increased by 22 percentage points, or from 18 percent (3 of 17 members) on January 19, 2017, to 40 percent (6 of 15 members) about 15 months later on March 31, 2018. This compares to 2009 when the percentage of members serving on BOSC with a government affiliation remained at zero percent on January 19, 2009, (11 members) and about 15 months later on March 31, 2010, (9 members). Other than the SAB, there were no notable changes after January 2017 in the regional affiliation of members of the 10 committees for which we analyzed this characteristic. In addition to the SAB, we analyzed the regional affiliation of three other committees individually and the remaining six committees combined. The largest change in regional affiliation after January 2017 that we did not identify as notable also occurred with the SAB. Members affiliated with the northeast region decreased by more than 14 percentage points, or from 28 percent (13 of 47 members) on January 19, 2017, to 14 percent (6 of 44 members) about 15 months later on March 31, 2018. This compares to 2009 when the percentage of members affiliated with the northeast region stayed about the same, changing from 20 percent (8 of 40 members) on January 19, 2009, to 18 percent (7 of 39 members) about 15 months later on March 31, 2010. Other than BOSC, the Clean Air Act Advisory Committee, and the Pesticide Program Dialogue Committee, there were no notable changes after January 2017 to membership turnover for the 14 committees for which we analyzed this characteristic. In addition to these three committees, we analyzed the membership turnover of six other committees individually and the remaining five committees combined. Our analysis shows that the largest change in membership turnover after January 2017 that we did not identify as notable occurred with the SAB. Of the members serving on this committee on January 19, 2017, 45 percent (21 of 47 members) were no longer serving about 15 months later on March 31, 2018. This compares to 2009 when 35 percent (14 of 40 members) serving on January 19, 2009, were not serving about 15 months later on March 31, 2010. There was no notable change in the percentage decrease of meetings held before and after January 2017 compared to a similar time frame before and after January 2009. We analyzed the number of meetings held by 18 committees. Our analysis shows that for the 18 committees combined, the number of meetings decreased by 40 percent (from 90 to 54 meetings) from the approximately 15 month period before January 2017 to the approximately 15 month period after January 2017. This compares to a 27 percent decrease in meetings (from 164 to 120 meetings) from the approximately 15-month period before January 2009 to the approximately 15-month period after January 2009. Overall, there was a decrease in the number of meetings from before January 2009 to after January 2017. The number of meetings held by the 18 committees combined decreased 67 percent (from 164 to 54 meetings) from the approximately 15-month period before January 2009 to the approximately 15-month period after January 2017. Figure 5 illustrates the decrease in the number of meetings held during this time frame. The figure shows the number of meetings held by SAB separately because of the relatively large number of meetings that it held relative to the other committees. EPA’s federal advisory committees play an important role in advising the agency. EPA generally followed its established process for 15 of the 17 advisory committees that appointed or reappointed committee members during the time period we reviewed. However, EPA did not follow a key step in its process for appointing 20 members to two committees that advise the agency on environmental regulatory matters, among other things. The agency did not prepare draft membership grids with staff rationales for proposed membership, the documents intended to reflect EPA staff input on the best qualified and most appropriate candidates for achieving balanced committee membership before appointing these members. EPA officials told us in March 2019 that they did not prepare draft membership grids, as recommended by EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee Handbook, because EPA management requested a series of briefings instead. There may be benefits to following different procedures; however, under EPA’s established process, agency staff are to document in draft membership grids and include in appointment packets their rationales for recommending the candidates they deem best qualified and most appropriate for achieving balanced committees. By directing officials responsible for appointing committee members to prepare draft membership grids and include them in appointment packets for all committees, the agency would have better assurance that it could show how it made appointment decisions to achieve the best qualified and most appropriate candidates for balanced committee membership. EPA also did not consistently ensure that committee members appointed as SGEs met federal ethics requirements, and as part of its periodic review of its ethics program, EPA did not evaluate through audits or spot- checks the quality of financial disclosure reviews conducted by deputy ethics officials for these committee members. Until EPA’s Ethics Office periodically evaluates—for example, through audits or spot-checks—the quality of financial disclosure reviews conducted for SGEs appointed to EPA advisory committees, it will not have reasonable assurance that it will address noncompliance with federal ethics requirements and prevent conflicts of interest among SGEs appointed to EPA advisory committees. We are making the following two recommendations to EPA: The EPA Administrator should direct EPA officials responsible for appointing advisory committee members to follow a key step in its appointment process—developing and including draft membership grids in appointment packets with staff rationales for proposed membership— for all committees. (Recommendation 1) EPA’s Designated Agency Ethics Official should direct EPA’s Ethics Office, as part of its periodic review of EPA’s ethics program, to evaluate—for example, through audits or spot-checks—the quality of financial disclosure reviews for special government employees appointed to EPA advisory committees. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of this report to EPA for review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix IV, EPA disagreed with a key finding related to the first recommendation, with how we conducted some of our data analyses, and with some of the data points we presented. EPA agreed with the findings and conclusions related to the second recommendation. EPA also provided other comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. EPA stated that it believed a key finding related to the draft report’s first recommendation—that EPA follow, for all committees, the key step in its appointment process related to developing draft membership grids—was in error and should be removed from the final version of the report. EPA also stated that it followed all membership steps outlined in agency guidance with the exception of two committees, SAB and CASAC, who substituted the development of a membership grid with what the agency states was a more rigorous examination of the candidates (a series of briefings with senior management discussing the strengths and weaknesses of potential candidates). EPA stated that this is within the discretion of the EPA Administrator and that the vetting of candidates for SAB and CASAC occurred in a different manner than in previous years with a process more robust than membership grids. In addition, EPA stated that the public comment process was more robust, going beyond what was prescribed in the traditional membership process. According to EPA, for SAB and CASAC, the public was offered additional opportunity to provide input on all nominated candidates under consideration. We agree that conducting such briefings is within the discretion of the EPA Administrator, and we did not assess the outcomes of the membership appointment process. However, it remains that for SAB and CASAC, EPA did not follow a key step in its established appointment process—as documented in its agency-wide handbook—in which agency staff are to document in draft membership grids their rationales for recommending the candidates they deem best qualified and most appropriate for achieving balanced committees. While there may be benefits to following any number of alternative processes for appointing committee members, as EPA stated in its Federal Advisory Committee Advisory Handbook, EPA developed the handbook to help agency officials comply with FACA requirements. For these two advisory committees, EPA did not follow its established committee appointment process, impeding EPA’s ability to ensure that it consistently meets— across all of its advisory committees—FACA’s purpose of encouraging uniform committee appointment procedures. Furthermore, EPA did not provide documentation of the “more rigorous examination” of candidates it conducted in briefings. In its written comments, EPA stated that the SAB Staff Office documented staff evaluations in briefing documents and that we did not request such documents. However, we requested all appointment packets for the 17 committees that appointed or reappointed committee members from fiscal year 2017 through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2018. These appointment packets were to contain the documents used by EPA management to make appointment and reappointment decisions. EPA did not include the briefing documents in their packets for the SAB or CASAC, impeding EPA’s ability to ensure that it consistently meets— across all of its advisory committees—FACA’s purpose of encouraging uniform committee appointment procedures. Nor did the agency provide any such documentation in subsequent discussions about the extent to which the agency followed its established process. Our most recent meeting with EPA took place on March 19, 2019. As appropriate, we modified the report to further clarify our specific finding. Moreover, EPA disagreed with how we conducted some of our data analyses and with some of the data points we presented. We took numerous steps to ensure the accuracy of the data points presented in this report. In some instances, we identified missing or inconsistent data and shared this information with EPA officials. EPA provided some corrected data for members with missing or inconsistent appointment- date data from October 1, 2015 to March 31, 2018. We also asked EPA staff to confirm that the data had been updated in the FACA database, discussing the data with individual EPA staff members, conducting logic tests and spot-checking the data to identify errors and inconsistencies, and providing EPA with an opportunity to review and correct in writing the data presented prior to preparing our draft report. Also, in its written comments, EPA stated that we did not review data for BOSC subcommittees. Our methodology focused on the composition of committees and not their subcommittees. We continue to believe that the methodology we employed to analyze data was appropriate. We outline our rationale in appendix I, which includes the steps we took to ensure data reliability. For these reasons, we do not plan to make any further changes based on the additional data EPA provided. Lastly, EPA did not dispute our findings and conclusions related to the second recommendation that the agency evaluate, for example, through audits or spot checks, the quality of financial disclosure reviews for special government employees appointed to EPA advisory committees. EPA noted that at the time of our audit, its Ethics Office was understaffed. In its written comments, EPA said that it has now resolved these staffing issues and is engaged in a full and thorough review of all employees’ (including special government employees serving on federal advisory committees) ethics forms to ensure they meet all ethics requirements. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Administrator of the U.S. General Services Administration, and the Director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff members have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3841 or gomezj@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff members who made major contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. To describe the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) established process for appointing members to serve on EPA advisory committees, we identified and reviewed the federal laws, regulations, and policies that are relevant to EPA’s process for appointing advisory committee members. To ensure that we correctly identified all relevant laws, regulations, and guidance, we consulted with: (1) the Committee Management Secretariat at the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), which issues regulations and guidance for Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) committees government-wide; (2) the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, which develops ethics-related regulations for executive branch employees; and (3) EPA. Examples of EPA guidance that we reviewed include EPA’s Federal Advisory Committee Handbook, Strengthening and Improving Membership on EPA Federal Advisory Committees, and EPA Ethics Advisory 2008-02. To evaluate the extent to which EPA followed its established process for appointing members from fiscal year 2017 through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2018, we reviewed pertinent documentation from the 17 committees that appointed or reappointed advisory committee members during this time frame. The remaining committees did not appoint any committee members during the time frame we reviewed. For the above- mentioned 17 committees, we reviewed all advisory committee appointment packets—each of which can contain appointment documents for numerous appointees or reappointees—produced during this time. We also reviewed the first section (Section 1: Identifying Information and Record of Agency Review) of the Confidential Financial Disclosure Form for EPA Special Government Employees (EPA Form 3110-48) for 74 individuals who were required to submit them to EPA to determine if they met federal financial-disclosure-reporting requirements. We reviewed all 74 of the forms provided by the 8 committees that appointed or reappointed special government employees (SGE) to serve on a committee from fiscal year 2017 through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2018. Additionally, we interviewed EPA officials involved with appointing committee members to understand the steps these officials took. We then compared the steps they described taking with selected steps in EPA’s established process for appointing members to evaluate the extent to which the agency followed its process. We focused on steps in the appointment process that were to be documented in the appointment packets, which EPA used to support appointment decisions. Specifically, we reviewed those aspects of the process for which EPA had documentary evidence, and we evaluated the implementation of ethics oversight requirements that are relevant to EPA’s committee-member appointment process. To determine whether the agency followed selected steps in its established process, two senior analysts reviewed the appointment packets. Specifically, one senior analyst conducted the primary analysis for about half of the 22 appointment packets we received, while the other conducted the primary analysis for the remaining packets. Afterwards, each analyst reviewed the other’s conclusions and noted agreement or disagreement based on the evidence provided. In some cases, discussion was necessary to resolve differences of opinion between the two analysts. Those discussions were documented. If additional documentation was necessary to resolve differences of opinion, we obtained additional information from the agency. The two analysts reached agreement on all of the packets. To describe how, if at all, selected characteristics of EPA’s advisory committees changed after January 2017, we analyzed information from the FACA database, a publically-available database maintained by GSA. The database contains information about FACA advisory committees that agencies, including EPA, are required to provide. The initial scope of our review was the 22 committees in existence on March 31, 2018. Of these 22 committees, we excluded from all of our analyses the four committees that were established after November 2007 because this is the earliest date of one of our analyses. We also excluded four other committees from the three analyses that rely on member appointment start and end dates (committee composition, membership turnover, and regional affiliation) because of missing or inconsistent data. Additionally, we excluded some other committees from some of our analyses because of other types of data reliability issues or because of the nature of the characteristic. To assess the reliability of the committee data, we reviewed database technical documentation and interviewed GSA and EPA officials to identify any potential issues with our planned analysis of the data, among other things, and determined that overall the data were sufficiently reliable for conducting analysis to describe changes in selected member and committee characteristics for our selected time periods. We discuss additional steps we took to assess the reliability of the data and data reliability issues with the FACA database at the end of this appendix. Additionally, appendix II identifies which committees we excluded from which analyses and the reasons why. Primarily using information available in the FACA database, we compared changes in four committee characteristics across committees and changes in presidential administrations. Specifically, we measured the characteristics before and after January 20, 2017, and compared them to similar periods before and after January 20, 2009. Additionally, we also compared the characteristics to those before and after January 21, 2013, to provide context to our findings and identify any patterns over time in the data. The four characteristics we measured and compared across committees and changes in presidential administrations were: Number of committee meetings For the first two characteristics, we compared across committees the percentage of members in the characteristics’ categories on either January 19, 2017, or January 19, 2009, to a day about 15 months later (either March 31, 2010, or March 31, 2018). For membership turnover, we compared across committees the percentage of members on either January 19, 2017, or January 19, 2009, who left a committee by about 15 months later (either March 31, 2010, or March 31, 2018). We chose March 31, 2018, to allow for a period of time after January 2017 for changes to occur in committee characteristics, and the fiscal year 2018 data file we received from GSA was updated as of March 31, 2018. For the fourth characteristic, we compared across committees the number of meetings held in the 15 months before January 20, 2009 and January 20, 2017, to a similar period after those dates (November 12, 2007, to March 31, 2010, or November 12, 2015, to March 31, 2018). To identify changes to a characteristic that were notable, we used the following methodology. First we identified any changes after January 2017 that were large relative to other changes to that characteristic after January 2017. If we identified a relatively large change, we then compared it to changes to the characteristic after January 2009 to assess whether it was large relative to those changes. If it was, we would identify the change as notable. The committees we analyzed individually had at least 10 members (or 10 meetings) in the relevant time periods being measured, with the exception of two committees which had nine members on March 31, 2010. We analyzed the other committees combined since relatively small changes in counts would have a relatively large impact on percentages. We measured the committee composition of 5 of 18 committees. We excluded 4 of the 18 committees because of data reliability issues and 9 committees because they were not staffed primarily with SGEs. We limited the committee composition analysis to SGEs because SGEs are expected to provide their best judgement free from conflicts of interest, rather than represent a particular viewpoint. We analyzed two of the five committees individually and the other three committees combined. To measure the composition of the five committees, we first categorized each member’s occupation from the “occupation/affiliation” field in the FACA database into one of six categories. The categories were: non-government organization (NGO); or other. To assign the categories, one GAO analyst reviewed the occupation/affiliation data for each member and assigned one of five categories (academic, consultant, government, industry, or NGO) to each member. In instances where it was unclear what category to assign, the analyst conducted online searches regarding the occupation/affiliation information to identify the type of entity and assign a category. We assigned the category “other” in 30 instances where the member was affiliated with more than one of the other categories, not affiliated with any of the other categories (for example, retired), or for which the FACA database did not provide sufficient information to assign one of the other categories. A second analyst reviewed the reasonableness of the categories assigned by the first analyst—including the additional research. The two analysts reached consensus on the categories for each member. We then applied the methodology described above to identify notable changes in committee composition after January 2017. We measured the regional affiliation of 10 of 18 committees. We excluded 8 committees because of data reliability issues. We analyzed 4 of the 10 committees individually and the other 6 committees combined. To measure the regional affiliation of the 10 committees, we assigned one of four U.S. Census regions (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) to each committee member based on data in the “occupation/affiliation” field in the FACA database for that member—in most instances, state information is included in this field. We then applied the methodology described above to identify notable changes in regional affiliation to the period after January 2017. The regions were: Western. We measured membership turnover in 14 of 18 committees. We excluded 4 committees because of data reliability issues. We analyzed 9 of the committees individually and the other 5 committees combined. To measure membership turnover of the 14 committees, we used date fields indicating when committee members began and ended their terms to determine the percentages of members on a committee on January 19, 2017, and January 19, 2009, who were not members about 15 months later. We then applied the methodology described above to identify notable changes in membership turnover after January 2017. We measured the change in the number of meetings for 18 committees. We analyzed two of the committees individually and the other 16 committees combined. To measure this characteristic, we used data on the date that meetings were held (we used the date that the meeting began if it was a multi-day meeting). We then applied the methodology described above to identify notable changes in the number of meetings after January 2017. We assessed the reliability of the data provided to us by GSA and took certain steps to prepare the data for analysis. GSA provided us with data files downloaded to Excel from its FACA database from October 1, 2005, to March 31, 2018, for our analysis. GSA maintains the FACA database on a fiscal year basis. During the fiscal year, staff in each agency, including EPA, are to enter data to reflect any changes about the agency’s FACA committees. At the end of each fiscal year, GSA is to perform, in conjunction with each agency, an annual comprehensive review of the data entered into the database by the agency for that fiscal year. According to GSA officials, these reviews constitute the agency’s main process for ensuring the reliability of the database. Once the review is complete, the data are locked down, meaning they can no longer be changed. We received data through the 2017 fiscal year after GSA completed the 2017 review. Because this latest GSA review was the end of fiscal year 2017 and we wanted to include data into 2018, we requested that EPA update the database to March 31, 2018, for each committee for certain data fields relevant to our analyses. We asked that for each committee, the EPA staff member responsible for entering a committee’s data in the FACA database provide confirmation to us that the data had been updated through March 31, 2018. After we received confirmation that data for the 22 committees in existence on March 31, 2018, had been updated, GSA staff provided us the data update for EPA committees from October 1, 2017, through March 31, 2018. To further assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed the database’s technical documentation and interviewed GSA and EPA officials to identify any potential issues with our planned analysis of the data. We conducted logic tests and spot-checked the data to identify errors and inconsistences. For example, we scanned committee member’s names to identify potential duplicates of the same person in the same committee and made corrections where appropriate. If a person served on more than one committee, we included that person separately for each committee on which he or she served. For each member, we also checked the appointment start and end dates indicated in each fiscal year for inconsistencies across fiscal years. In some instances, we identified missing or inconsistent data in these dates and shared this information with EPA officials. EPA was able to provide some corrected data for members with missing or inconsistent appointment-date data from October 1, 2015, to March 31, 2018. We excluded from our analyses four committees for which over 30 percent of members had appointment date issues we were not able to resolve, as well as individual members with unresolved date issues for the committees we included in the analysis. We also checked the 2018 data that GSA provided to us against the data posted to EPA’s website. We determined that overall the data were sufficiently reliable for conducting analysis to describe changes in selected member and committee characteristics for our selected time periods. Finally, we took steps to structure the data provided by GSA in the format needed for our analyses. Specifically, because GSA maintains its data on a fiscal year basis, the data we received from GSA contained a separate row in the database for each committee member for each fiscal year that he or she was a member. To facilitate our analyses, we transposed the dataset so there was one row for each member (for each committee, if a member was in more than one committee) that contained the data from all of the fiscal year records for that member. We conducted this performance audit from October 2017 to July 2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Table 3 provides information about each of the 22 advisory committees managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as of March 31, 2018. For each of these committees, the table also identifies whether we included it in one or more of our analyses. If we excluded a committee from certain analyses, we also explain why. Table 4 summarizes the number of advisory-committee appointment packets for which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) did or did not follow the steps we evaluated for appointing members to serve on EPA advisory committees. In addition to the individuals named above, Joseph Thompson (Assistant Director), John Delicath, Charles Egan, Chad Gorman, Richard Johnson, Yvonne Jones, Mary Koenen, James Lager, Amber Sinclair, and Kiki Theodoropoulos made important contributions to this report.\n","   2  According to the National Research Council, although the exact details cannot be predicted with certainty, climate change poses serious risks to many of the physical and ecological systems on which society depends. Moreover, according to key scientific assessments, the effects and costs of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts will increase in significance as what are considered rare events become more common and intense because of climate change. According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, extreme weather events are directly traceable to loss of life, rising food and energy prices, increasing costs of disaster relief and insurance, fluctuations in property values, and concerns about national security. Table 1 shows seven effects commonly associated with climate change that DOD has documented. According to a 2010 National Research Council report on making informed decisions about climate change and our October 2009 report on climate change adaptation, most decision makers need a basic set of information to understand and make choices about how to adapt to the effects of climate change. This set of information includes information and analysis about observed climate conditions, information about observed climate effects and vulnerabilities, and projections of what climate change might mean for the local area. In November 2015, we found that in order for climate information to be useful, it must be tailored to meet the needs of each decision maker, such as an engineer responsible for building a bridge in a specific location, a county planner responsible for managing development over a larger region, or a federal official managing a national-scale program. Agencies across the federal government collect and manage many types of climate information, including observational records from satellites and weather monitoring stations on temperature and precipitation, among other things; projections from complex climate models; and tools to make this information more meaningful to decision makers. For example, the Fourth National Climate Assessment, completed in November 2018 by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, references various sources of climate information, including projected temperature and precipitation data. Likewise, in 2016, a multi-agency group led by the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) developed a report and accompanying database of future sea level projections and extreme water levels, which as of May 2019 contained sea level change projections for 1,813 DOD sites worldwide. Climate projections are typically a range of possible future scenarios for particular time frames. Multiple future scenarios allow for planners and engineers to see a range of possible conditions that could occur at various points in time. For example, a planner or engineer could consider four different future scenarios occurring over the course of 20, 40, or 60 years or over the service life of the project being designed. Figure 1 shows an example of sea level change projections provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Specifically, the chart shows historical mean sea levels and multiple scenarios of projected relative sea level rise in Norfolk, Virginia. The chart shows the historical annual mean sea level from 1960 to 2018 through the bold black line. The projections use 2000 as a starting point, and so overlap with the historical data. Relative sea level rise takes into account changes in land levels—in the Norfolk area the land is generally subsiding over time. Each scenario is based on different assumptions about future greenhouse gas emissions, according to an official from NOAA’s National Ocean Service. Planners and engineers can use the multiple scenarios to evaluate when potential effects could occur and determine their risk tolerances to inform their planning or design choices. Figure 2 similarly shows the same historical mean sea levels at Norfolk, Virginia, as well as the very likely range of projections of future relative sea levels, according to the National Ocean Service. This chart shows the range of possibilities considered very likely—those between the low and intermediate scenarios in figure 1—according to an official from NOAA’s National Ocean Service. Master planning for military installations involves the evaluation of factors affecting the present and future physical development and operation of a military installation. DOD requires all installations to develop master plans. DOD’s instruction on real property management states that plans must be based on a strategic assessment of the operational mission and expected use of the installation. The plans must cover at least a 10-year period and be updated every 5 years, or more often if necessary. The plans must include lists, by year, of all construction projects, major repair and sustainment projects, and restoration and modernization projects needed within the time period covered by the plan. Individual DOD facilities projects within installations must be designed in accordance with DOD’s facilities design standards, which are defined in the Unified Facilities Criteria. Unified Facilities Criteria are technical manuals and specifications used for planning, design, construction, maintenance, and operations of all DOD facilities projects. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, and the Air Force Civil Engineer Center are responsible for administering and updating the Unified Facilities Criteria. The Unified Facilities Criteria include a core group of 27 standards that apply to building systems found in most DOD facility construction projects, and include standards such as architecture, roofing, and civil engineering. Engineers and planners apply the criteria that are most appropriate for their individual facilities projects to their project proposals and designs. Table 2 shows excerpts from requirements and guidance to project designers in the Unified Facilities Criteria relevant to the consideration of climate. Table 2. Excerpts from Unified Facilities Criteria Requirements and Guidance on Consideration of Climate Excerpt consider site-specific, long-term, climate change impacts such as drought, flood, wind, and wildfire risks. Knowing the probable wind speed and direction in a particular month can be helpful in construction and mission planning as well as in designing structures that experience severe wind-driven rain or drifting snow. Pumps, piping, and equipment must be protected from the weather. In cold climates pumps and piping must be protected from freezing temperatures. The pump station building must comply with 1-200-01 , be constructed of noncombustible materials and meet applicable building standoff distances. In new construction, the roof system selection is an integral part of the overall building design and must take into account interior building usage and climate. For example, the building can be designed to prevent outward moisture drive, support heavy roof systems (such as garden roofs or paver systems), or sloped for the desired durability (life cycle cost benefit) and aesthetic considerations. Building shape, orientation, and design must utilize the site seasonal environmental factors to minimize annual facility energy use and to optimize daylighting. Coordinate building and glazing orientation and architectural shading with seasonal solar angles and prevailing winds to enhance energy performance of the building within the site-specific micro climate. Streets, paved parking lots, roofs, and other impermeable surfaces allow no infiltration of runoff and provide little resistance to flow. Runoff draining from these surfaces can be highly concentrated and move at a velocity greater than runoff flowing over an unpaved surface. Soils must be protected from this erosive force, particularly at the edges of impermeable surfaces and soils. 11988 directs all Federal agencies to avoid floodplain development wherever there is a practicable alternative. When development within the floodplain is considered, evaluate alternative site locations to avoid or minimize adverse impacts to the floodplain. When mission needs require siting a building within or partially within the 100-year floodplain, indicate…the base flood elevation…and the minimum design flood elevation…. Extreme weather and climate change effects can damage infrastructure, requiring repairs and resulting in budgetary risks (i.e., costs) to DOD. While no individual weather event can be definitively linked to climate change, particular weather events can demonstrate the vulnerability of military facilities. For example, in October 2018, Hurricane Michael devastated Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, shutting down most base operations until December; causing severe damage to the flight line, drone runway, and other base facilities including family housing; and destroying the base’s marina. The Air Force estimates that repairs at the base will cost about $3 billion and take 5 or more years to complete. Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Stations Cherry Point and New River in North Carolina sustained heavy damage to facilities, housing, and training locations from Hurricane Florence in September 2018. The Marine Corps estimates that the recovery from the hurricane damage will cost about $3.6 billion and take years to complete. In 2014, we reported that more frequent and more severe extreme weather events and climate change effects may result in increased fiscal exposure for DOD. In the same report, officials provided examples of costs associated with extreme weather and climate change effects at DOD facilities. For example, officials from a Navy shipyard we visited stated that the catastrophic damage that could result from the flooding of a submarine in dry dock could cause substantial repair costs. In 2017, we found that DOD installations overseas face operational and budgetary risks posed by weather events and climate change effects at the military services’ installations in each of DOD’s geographic combatant commands. We recommended that the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force work with the Office of the Secretary of Defense to issue a requirement to their installations to systematically track the costs associated with extreme weather events and climate change effects. DOD did not concur with this recommendation. In its response, DOD stated that tracking impacts and costs associated with extreme weather is important, but that the science of attributing these events to a changing climate is not supported by previous GAO reports. DOD also stated that associating a single event with climate change is difficult and does not warrant the time and money expended in doing so. However, as we stated in our response to DOD’s comments, installations generally have the capability to track the costs associated with extreme weather events, which are projected to become more frequent and intense as a result of climate change. There is substantial budgetary risk resulting from weather effects associated with climate change, and these types of repairs are neither budgeted for nor clearly represented in the federal budget process. As of April 2019, the military departments have not implemented this recommendation. Fifteen of the 23 installations we visited or contacted had integrated some considerations of extreme weather or climate change effects into their plans. For example, Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, partnered with the City of Hampton, Virginia, to study the effects of sea level rise. A 2018 addendum to the installation’s 2010 joint land use study with the City of Hampton outlined climate vulnerabilities and identified recommendations for actions to increase installation resilience. Separately, after sustaining damage from Hurricane Isabel in 2003, the installation required all new development to be constructed to a minimum elevation of 10.5 feet above sea level, higher than the flooding associated with the hurricane and one foot higher than the flooding anticipated from a storm with a 1-in-500 chance of occurring in any given year. As DOD noted in its January 2019 report to Congress on climate-related vulnerabilities, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, of which Langley Air Force Base is a part, has experienced 14 inches in relative sea level rise since 1930, due in part to land subsidence, and has experienced more frequent and severe flooding as a result. The 611th Civil Engineer Squadron, based at Joint Base Elmendorf- Richardson in Alaska, partnered with the University of Alaska, Anchorage, to develop site-specific predictive models of coastal erosion for two radar sites on the North Slope of Alaska. The squadron plans to use this information in the future to develop possible alternative facilities projects to address the erosion risks. Squadron officials told us they consulted with the military users of the radars to determine the length of time to plan for their continued use and that they intend to use this information to develop plans to address this coastal erosion. The North Slope radar sites are experiencing greater than anticipated coastal erosion rates, which have begun to threaten the infrastructure supporting the sites. Fort Irwin, California, in response to severe flash flooding in 2013 that caused loss of power and significant damage to base infrastructure, worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to develop a plan to improve stormwater drainage. The 2014 plan recommended a series of infrastructure projects, some of which Fort Irwin has implemented; others remain to be implemented, depending on the availability of funding. Figure 2 depicts flooding damage in 2013 at Fort Irwin and a stormwater diversion channel subsequently built by the installation. The flash flooding on the installation caused damage to roads and other facilities throughout the installation, according to officials. The installation subsequently raised berms and built other structures, such as the diversion channel shown in figure 3, to divert stormwater from installation facilities. Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina, reported that the installation plans to award a contract to study sea level rise at the installation and incorporate the results into the next iteration of its master plan. The installation stated that incorporating the study’s results is included in the scope of work for the contract that has been awarded for the master plan update. Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, noted in its 2017 master plan that climate change and sea level rise are expected to exacerbate effects to the installation from tidal flooding and storm surge, increasing risks to installation assets and capabilities. The plan established a goal of identifying measures that could minimize the effect of sea level rise on the installation. With the majority of the installation near mean sea level, Naval Station Norfolk is vulnerable to frequent flooding that is disruptive to operations. Figure 4 depicts flooding at Naval Station Norfolk. Installation officials told us that such floods can interfere with traffic on base, thus reducing the ability of those working on the installation to transit within, to, and from the base. Naval Base San Diego, California, noted in its most recent master plan that local climate change effects include water and energy shortages, loss of beaches and coastal property, and higher average temperatures, among others. The plan also stated that Naval Base San Diego should be funded to conduct a study to determine installation-specific effects of sea level rise. Navy Region Southwest subsequently partnered with the Port of San Diego to study local effects of sea level rise, which installation officials said will help them understand the effects of sea level rise on the base. Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, participated in a study of the effects of sea level rise on the installation and on certain other DOD installations in North Carolina and Florida. An installation official stated that installation officials have used the results of the study to make planning decisions, in particular by feeding the study data into the installation’s mapping of potential flood zones. The 10-year study, which concluded in 2017, was funded by SERDP and was based at Camp Lejeune to, among other things, understand the effects of climate change at Camp Lejeune. Camp Lejeune officials and one of the scientists involved in the study told us that installation officials have used the study’s results to make decisions about where to site buildings so as to take into account the possible future condition of marshes on the base. However, 8 of the 23 installations we visited or contacted had not integrated considerations of extreme weather or climate change effects into their master plans or related installation planning documents. For example, Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam, Hawaii, did not consider extreme weather and climate change effects in its most recent master plan, although it is located in an area that has been subject to tropical storms and where, according to projections in the DOD database of sea level change scenarios, further sea level rise is anticipated. Specifically, under the highest scenario in the database, sea level at Naval Station Pearl Harbor, part of the joint base, could rise more than 3 feet by 2065. The lowest elevation point on the base is 0.6 feet below sea level. The installation stated that it plans to incorporate the effects of climate change into the next update to its facilities master plan. Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, Hawaii, did not consider extreme weather or climate change effects in its most recent master plan, although it is co-located with Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam and therefore shares the same weather and climate conditions noted previously. Fort Wainwright, Alaska, officials told us they had not considered climate change as part of the installation’s master planning. Officials noted that the majority of the base is on thaw-stable permafrost that would be unlikely to be significantly affected by rising temperatures, but some areas of the base are on less stable permafrost. DOD noted in its January 2019 report to Congress that thawing permafrost can decrease the structural stability of buildings and other infrastructure that is built on it. Camp Pendleton, California, officials told us that although they are aware of a variety of climate-related challenges to their installation and have taken or plan to take some steps to address them, an example of which we discuss later in this report, the installation has not yet considered extreme weather and climate change effects in its master plan. The officials stated that they are still planning based on historical conditions rather than considering possible future conditions. DOD’s Unified Facilities Criteria standard specific to master planning states that where changing external conditions affect planning decisions, master planners should seek to understand, monitor, and adapt to these changes, including changes in climatic conditions such as temperature, rainfall patterns, storm frequency and intensity, and water levels. DOD’s directive on climate change adaptation further states that military departments should integrate climate change considerations into their plans. The directive also states that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment should consider climate change adaptation and resilience in the installation planning process, including the effects of climate change on both built and natural infrastructure. Our findings based on the 23 installations we reviewed for this report are consistent with our prior reports on extreme weather and climate change effects at military installations. Specifically, installations have not consistently integrated these considerations into their master plans or related installation planning documents. In May 2014, we reported that some domestic installations had integrated considerations of changing climatic conditions into their installation planning documents, but DOD had not provided key information—such as how to use climate change projections—to help ensure that efficient and consistent actions would be taken across installations. We recommended that DOD further clarify the planning actions that should be taken in installation master plans to account for climate change, to include further information about changes in applicable building codes and design standards that account for potential climate change effects and further information about potential projected climate change effects on individual installations. However, as of January 2019, DOD had not fully implemented this recommendation. For example, as we discuss later in this report, DOD’s updates to its facilities design standards lacked guidance on the use of climate projections. DOD also had not provided information on a range of potential effects of climate change on individual installations. DOD has taken some positive steps in this area, such as making available to the military services a database of sea level change scenarios for 1,774 DOD sites worldwide. However, DOD has not provided other specific types of climate projections, which we discuss in more depth later in this report. Moreover, in November 2017 we reported that about a third of the installations in our sample of overseas installations had integrated climate change adaptation into their installation plans, but the lack of key guidance and updated design standards to reflect climate change concerns hampered their ability to consistently incorporate climate change adaptation into their plans. We recommended, among other things, that the military departments integrate climate change data and projections into DOD’s facilities criteria and periodically revise those standards based on any new projections, as appropriate. DOD partially concurred, and as of January 2019, an official from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment stated that the office was continuing to work with the military departments to evaluate how to effectively translate the latest climate data into a form usable by installation planners and facilities project designers. Based on our findings for this review, we continue to believe that DOD should take all necessary steps to implement these recommendations. While 15 of the 23 installations we visited or contacted had integrated some consideration of extreme weather or climate change effects into their planning documents, only two of these installations had taken steps to fully assess the weather and climate risks to the installation or develop plans to address identified risks. DOD has taken some broad actions to assess risk to installations from extreme weather and climate change effects. For example, in January 2018, DOD issued a report to Congress on the results of its survey of installations on the extent to which they faced a variety of extreme weather or climate effects. However, the survey responses constituted a preliminary assessment and were based on installations’ reporting of negative effects they had already experienced from extreme weather effects, rather than assessments of all future vulnerabilities based on climate projections. DOD noted that the information in the survey responses is highly qualitative and is best used as an initial indicator of where a more in-depth assessment may be warranted. However, except for two of the installations in our sample, the installations’ master plans and related installation planning documents did not (1) identify a range of possible extreme weather events and climate change effects that could affect the installation, (2) assess the likelihood of each event occurring and the possible effect on the installation, and (3) identify potential responses to these events. For example, Naval Air Station Key West, Florida, included discussion of the effects of sea level rise and storm surge on the installation in its master plan, as well as steps it could take to mitigate these effects. However, although the installation experienced drought conditions rated severe in 2011 and extreme in 2015, its master plan does not discuss effects on the installation of drought, which, according to a DOD report to Congress, can pose significant risks to an installation, including implications for base infrastructure. All of the Air Force installations in our sample rated their degree of vulnerability to a range of climatic conditions—such as flood, temperature rise, and precipitation pattern changes—in their master plans, thereby identifying a range of possible climate events and the likelihood of each event. However, of those installations that identified a range of possible extreme weather and climate change effects that could affect the installation, most did not consistently identify potential responses to these events. The two exceptions—Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia—took the additional step of identifying possible actions to address these climate events. For example, Eglin Air Force Base rated itself as having a high vulnerability to storm surge, but a low vulnerability from rising temperatures, and identified steps the installation could take in facilities planning and design to mitigate the identified risks. The DOD directive on climate adaptation states that military departments should assess and manage risks to both built and natural infrastructure, including changes as appropriate to installation master planning, and should assess, incorporate, and manage the risks and effects of altered operating environments on capabilities and capacity, including basing. Moreover, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives. Risk assessment is the identification and analysis of risks related to achieving defined objectives in order to form a basis for designing responses to these risks. Our prior work has shown that assessing risks includes assessing both the likelihood of an event occurring and the effect the event would have. Agency leaders and subject matter experts should assess each risk by assigning the likelihood of the event’s occurrence and the potential effect if the event occurs. Despite a DOD directive requiring that the military departments assess and manage risks to both built and natural infrastructure, DOD has not required in the Unified Facilities Criteria standard that guides master planning that installations assess risks posed by extreme weather and climate change effects as part of their master plans or develop plans to address identified risks. Officials in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment acknowledged that the Unified Facilities Criteria standard on master planning does not explicitly require a risk assessment specifically for extreme weather or climate change as part of the master planning process. Because installations have not consistently assessed the risks from extreme weather and climate change effects as part of their master plans or identified potential responses to identified risks, they may formulate plans and make planning decisions without consideration of those risks. By assessing and developing actions to address these risks in their master plans, installations could better anticipate exposure of the facilities to greater than anticipated damage or degradation as a result of extreme weather events or climate change effects. Eight of the 23 installations we visited or contacted, as well as the Air Force unit responsible for the North Slope radar facilities, had made some use of climate projections to incorporate consideration of extreme weather and climate change effects into their master plans or related installation planning documents. For example, as noted previously, the 611th Civil Engineer Squadron was developing its own site-specific projections of coastal erosion affecting the North Slope radar sites in Alaska, and Norfolk Naval Shipyard considered local sea level rise projections in a study on mitigating flooding at its docks. However, officials from 11 of the 23 installations in our sample—including some from installations that had made some use of climate projections—cited the need for additional guidance from DOD or their military department headquarters on which projections to use in planning or on how to use them. This is consistent with our prior findings on DOD’s installation-level efforts to increase climate resilience. Our May 2014 report noted that installation officials told us they did not have the installation-level climate data from their military departments or from other DOD sources that they would need to understand the potential effects of climate change on their installations. We recommended, among other things, that DOD provide further direction on planning actions to account for climate change, including information about changes in applicable building codes and design standards and the projected effects of climate change on individual installations. DOD concurred but as of January 2019 had not fully implemented this recommendation, as noted previously. In December 2018, an official in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment stated that DOD plans to develop a policy on the use of sea level rise projections by some time in 2019 and eventually to incorporate these projections into the Unified Facilities Criteria. However, DOD has no current time table for incorporating guidance on the use of other types of climate projections into its Unified Facilities Criteria. The official stated that the department is working toward eventually incorporating the use of other types of climate projections into guidance but that these types of projections would have to be vetted by DOD subject matter experts and approved prior to adoption. DOD intends to move in this direction, according to the official, but DOD has not yet developed a defined process for evaluating and incorporating the use of additional climate projections into guidance. Our prior work has found that using the best available climate information, including forward-looking projections, can help an organization to manage climate-related risks. Until November 2018, DOD’s Unified Facilities Criteria on master planning stated that changes in climate conditions are to be determined from reliable and authorized sources of existing data but that to anticipate conditions during the design life of existing or planned new facilities and infrastructure, installations could also consider climate projections from reliable and authorized sources, such as, among others, the U.S. Global Change Research Office and the National Climate Assessment. In November 2018, in response to a statutory requirement in the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, DOD updated the Unified Facilities Criteria on master planning to specify that climate projections from reliable and authorized sources, such the U.S. Global Change Research Office and the National Climate Assessment, shall be considered and incorporated into military construction designs and modifications. DOD guidance states that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment provides guidance and direction on relevant technologies, engineering standards, tools, development and use of scenarios, and other approaches to enable prudent climate change adaptation and resilience. The guidance also states that military departments are to leverage authoritative environmental prediction sources for appropriate data and analysis products to assess the effects of weather and climate. Installations have not consistently used climate projections in their master plans because DOD has not provided detailed guidance on how to do so. Simply updating the language of the Unified Facilities Criteria on master planning in November 2018 to require the use of climate projections does not provide guidance to installations on how to use climate projections, such as what future time periods to consider and how to incorporate projections involving multiple future scenarios, nor does it identify the specific types of projections to use. The absence of guidance has hindered the ability of some installations to effectively apply the best available climate projections to their installation master planning. If they do not use climate projections in their master plans, installations risk failing to plan for changing climate and weather conditions and, as a result, could expose their facilities to greater risk of damage or degradation from extreme weather events and climate change effects. Incorporating such data into planning would help installation master planners better anticipate changing climate and weather conditions and increase the effectiveness of the installation’s long-term investments in its facilities. Eleven of the 23 installations we visited or contacted had designed or constructed one or more individual facilities projects to increase the resilience of the facilities themselves, or to increase the resilience of the installation more broadly, to extreme weather and climate change effects. For example, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia. In 2018, officials designed a project to build a maintenance hangar with a special foundation that would elevate the floor to 10 feet above the average high-water level at the project site and protect it against coastal storm flooding. Joint Base Langley-Eustis has experienced severe flooding in the past because of its low-lying geographical elevations in the Chesapeake Bay. The installation stated in its draft encroachment management action plan that the effects of climate change may exacerbate flooding issues through sea level rise or the increasing frequency and severity of storms. Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia. In 2018, shipyard officials designed a project to increase the installation’s resilience to storm-induced flooding, including building a floodwall to protect the dry docks that are used to perform maintenance on ships and submarines. Norfolk Naval Shipyard experiences extreme high tides three to five times a year on average and a significant hurricane on average once a year, according to an installation presentation, and flooding has been increasing over time in the area as relative sea levels have risen. The floodwall will enclose the dry docks, providing protection to critical assets and electrical utilities while they are in dry dock, among other things. Figure 5 depicts a flooded dry dock at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Virginia. Installation officials told us that flooding into dry docks poses risks to the ships being serviced there and to the performance of the base’s mission of servicing and maintaining Navy ships and submarines. Camp Pendleton, California. In 2018, as part of a project to construct a new aircraft landing zone, officials included protection of the nearby coastline, which had been rapidly eroding from the impact of ocean waves and rain storms. According to officials, the erosion has accelerated in recent years and has threatened not only landing zones along the coast, but also beaches that are used for amphibious assault training. Figure 6 depicts coastal erosion near a landing zone at Camp Pendleton, California. According to officials, the erosion leading to the gulley shown in the photograph has accelerated in recent years and advances further inland every year; it is now within feet of the landing zone. The officials told us that the erosion can threaten the function of the landing zone if it reaches that site. Fort Shafter, Hawaii. In 2016, officials constructed flood mitigation structures, including a flood control levee, to protect maintenance facilities being built in a flood zone. At the time, there were no adequate permanent maintenance facilities for units stationed at the base, and the only available land big enough to support the proposed maintenance facilities was located within a flood zone. Despite limited efforts to increase the resilience of facilities to extreme weather and climate change effects, officials from 17 of the military installations in our sample said that their individual facilities project designs generally did not consider climate projections. Of the installations that stated that they considered climate projections in facilities project designs, one military installation said it uses a study on sea level rise at the installation as a tool that incorporates forward-looking projections, and another installation said it uses a NOAA web-based tool, Sea Level Rise Viewer, for graphical representations of projected sea level rise. One installation noted that it had considered sea level rise projections in a pier design, which we discuss further below. A fourth installation said it plans to use a draft Navy study on the vulnerability of coastal Navy installations to sea level rise to inform an upcoming facilities project design. However, another installation said it has used energy consumption projections, which are not climate projections, and another installation cited a Navy climate adaptation handbook, which does not include climate projections for individual Navy installations. Moreover, over the course of our review of 23 installations, we were able to identify only one project as having a design informed by climate projections. Specifically, in 2018, officials from Naval Base San Diego, California, designed a project to demolish and replace an existing pier. The project’s design was informed by the expectation of sea level rise over the 75-year lifespan of the pier. An installation official told us that the consideration of rising sea levels was not part of the original project proposal, but when a contractor provided the sea level rise projections, installation officials decided to raise the pier by one foot. Figure 7 depicts a notional example of a pier—not specific to San Diego or any other particular location—raised to account for sea level rise. The Unified Facilities Criteria on piers and wharves states that the bottom elevation of the deck slab should be kept at least one foot above the extreme high water level. In this notional example, the pier is raised to account for an anticipated one-foot sea level rise, so that the bottom of the deck slab remains one foot above the extreme high water level, as shown in the figure. DOD guidance requires the military departments to assess and manage risks to both built and natural infrastructure, including making changes, as appropriate, to design and construction standards. The guidance also requires the military departments to leverage authoritative environmental prediction sources for appropriate data and analysis products to assess weather and climate effects. However, DOD’s Unified Facilities Criteria pertaining to project design, with the exception of the standard on high performance and sustainable building requirements, do not require consideration of climate projections as part of facilities project designs. The Unified Facilities Criteria standard on high performance and sustainable building requirements requires engineers to provide building design solutions that are responsive to any government-provided projections of climate change and determination of acceptable risk. We analyzed 27 core Unified Facilities Criteria, as well as 3 other Unified Facilities Criteria, Installation Master Planning, Design: Engineering Weather Data, DOD Building Code (General Building Requirements), and one facility criteria standard on Navy and Marine Corps Design Procedures. Our analysis showed that as of March 2019 these criteria, other than the Unified Facilities Criteria standard on installation master planning, do not identify authoritative sources of climate projections for use in facilities project designs. The Unified Facilities Criteria standard on installation master planning states that climate projections from the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the National Climate Assessment as well as the National Academy of Sciences shall be considered and incorporated into military construction designs and modifications. However, an official in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment acknowledged that this requirement in the standard on installation master planning is not sufficient on its own to apply to all facility project designs. Additionally, the standard on installation master planning does not identify the specific types of climate projections to use or how to locate them. Our analysis showed that the Unified Facilities Criteria do not provide guidance on how to incorporate projections into facilities project designs, such as how to use projections involving multiple future scenarios and what future time periods to consider. We found that while some Unified Facilities Criteria direct project designers to climate data, these are historical climate data rather than projections. For example, the following standards do not direct project designers to sources of climate projections: 2015) (change 1, Feb. 1, 2016). This guidance directs project designers to use long-term rainfall records, such as those from regional weather stations, and directs engineers toward a table that provides rainfall data for selected locations. However, information included in the guidance is historical and does not include or refer to projections. Unified Facilities Criteria 3-400-02, Design: Engineering Weather Data (Sept. 20, 2018). This guidance directs project designers toward instructions for accessing climate data for use in designing facilities and in mission planning. However, the guidance does not discuss the use of or specifically reference climate projections. Unified Facilities Criteria 3-201-01, Civil Engineering (Apr. 1, 2018) (change 1, Mar. 19, 2019). This guidance requires project designers to plan for flood hazard areas and, if the project is constructed within the 100-year floodplain, requires that the project design document include flood mitigation measures as part of the project’s scope of work. However, the guidance does not include or reference projections that would help engineers design for various potential flooding scenarios. As previously noted, in response to a statutory requirement, DOD updated its Unified Facilities Criteria on master planning in November 2018 to require installations to consider and incorporate reliable and authorized sources of data on changing environmental conditions. However, simply including this language does not provide guidance to installations on what sources of climate projections to consider and how to use them in designing facilities projects, such as what future time periods to consider and how to incorporate projections involving multiple future scenarios. In addition, the Unified Facilities Criteria standard on master planning provides requirements and guidance for installation master planning but not for the design of individual facilities projects. An official of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment stated that his office plans to develop a policy on the use of sea level rise projections by some time in 2019 and eventually to incorporate guidance on how to use sea level rise projections into the Unified Facilities Criteria or other guidance. This official added that there is currently no defined DOD process for vetting authoritative sources of climate projections, but that DOD plans to continue vetting sources for possible use, as appropriate. Furthermore, officials of 10 of the 23 military installations we reviewed stated that in order to incorporate such projections into project designs, they would need additional guidance from DOD or their military departments identifying authoritative sources of such projections or how to use climate projections that involve multiple future scenarios and different time periods. Ultimately, installations that do not consider climate projections in the design of their facilities projects may be investing in facilities projects without considering potential risks, such as potential future damage and degradation, which are associated with additional costs and reductions in capability. If DOD does not provide guidance on the use of climate projections in facilities designs, including what sources of climate projections to use, how to use projections involving multiple future scenarios, and what future time periods to consider, installation project designers will continue to lack direction on how to use climate projections. Further, if DOD does not update the Unified Facilities Criteria to require installations to consider climate projections in project designs and incorporate the department’s guidance on how to use climate projections in project designs, installation project designers may continue to exclude consideration of climate projections from facilities project designs. Considering climate projections in facilities projects would help DOD to reduce the climate-related risks to its facilities investments. DOD has a global real estate portfolio that supports the department’s global workforce and its readiness to execute its national security missions. The department has repeatedly acknowledged the threats of extreme weather and climate change effects to its installations, and as we have previously reported, has begun taking steps to increase the resilience of its infrastructure to these threats. We found that 15 of the 23 the installations we visited or contacted had considered some type of extreme weather or climate change effects in their plans, a positive step toward increasing resilience to these climate risks. However, not all had done so and most of the installations we visited or contacted did not fully assess the risks associated with extreme weather and climate change effects—including the likelihood of the threat, potential effects on the installation, and possible responses to mitigate such effects. Likewise, many of the installations did not consider climate projections in planning. Without fully assessing the risks of extreme weather and climate change effects, and without considering climate projections as part of the planning process, installations may make planning decisions that do not fully anticipate future climate conditions. By seeking to anticipate future climate conditions, DOD may be able to reduce climate-related risks to its facilities and the corresponding budgetary risks. Eleven of the 23 installations we visited or contacted had designed or implemented one or more construction projects that incorporated resilience to extreme weather or climate change effects. These projects illustrate some of the steps that can be taken to increase an installation’s resilience to climate risks. However, most of the installations had not considered climate projections in project design. Considering climate projections in facilities projects would help DOD to reduce the climate- related risks to its facilities investments. By updating its facilities project design standards to require installations to consider climate projections in project designs, identifying authoritative sources of climate projections, and providing guidance on how to use climate projections, DOD can aid installations to better position themselves to be resilient to the risks of extreme weather and climate change effects. We are making eight recommendations, including two to DOD and two to each of the military departments. Specifically, The Secretary of the Army should ensure that the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers works with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment; the Chief of Civil Engineers and Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command; and the Director of the Air Force Civil Engineer Center to update the Unified Facilities Criteria standard on installation master planning to require that master plans include (1) an assessment of the risks from extreme weather and climate change effects that are specific to the installation and (2) plans to address those risks as appropriate. (Recommendation 1) The Secretary of the Navy should ensure that the Chief of Civil Engineers and Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command works with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment, the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Director of the Air Force Civil Engineer Center to update the Unified Facilities Criteria standard on installation master planning to require that master plans include (1) an assessment of the risks from extreme weather and climate change effects that are specific to the installation and (2) plans to address those risks as appropriate. (Recommendation 2) The Secretary of the Air Force should ensure that the Director of the Air Force Civil Engineer Center works with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment; the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and the Chief of Civil Engineers and Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command to update the Unified Facilities Criteria standard on installation master planning to require that master plans include (1) an assessment of the risks from extreme weather and climate change effects that are specific to the installation and (2) plans to address those risks as appropriate. (Recommendation 3) The Secretary of Defense should issue guidance on incorporating climate projections into installation master planning, including—at a minimum— what sources of climate projections to use, how to use projections involving multiple future scenarios, and what future time periods to consider. (Recommendation 4) The Secretary of Defense should issue guidance on incorporating climate projections into facilities project designs, including—at a minimum—what sources of climate projections to use, how to use projections involving multiple future scenarios, and what future time periods to consider. (Recommendation 5) The Secretary of the Army should ensure that the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers works with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment; the Chief of Civil Engineers and Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command; and the Director of the Air Force Civil Engineer Center to update relevant Unified Facilities Criteria to require that installations consider climate projections in designing facilities projects and incorporate, as appropriate, DOD guidance on the use of climate projections in facilities project designs—including identification of authoritative sources of such projections, use of projections involving multiple future scenarios, and what future time periods to consider. (Recommendation 6) The Secretary of the Navy should ensure that the Chief of Civil Engineers and Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command works with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment, the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Director of the Air Force Civil Engineer Center to update relevant Unified Facilities Criteria to require that installations consider climate projections in designing facilities projects and incorporate, as appropriate, DOD guidance on the use of climate projections in facilities project designs— including identification of authoritative sources of such projections, use of projections involving multiple future scenarios, and what future time periods to consider. (Recommendation 7) The Secretary of the Air Force should ensure that the Director of the Air Force Civil Engineer Center works with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment; the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; and the Chief of Civil Engineers and Commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command to update relevant Unified Facilities Criteria to require that installations consider climate projections in designing facilities projects and incorporate, as appropriate, DOD guidance on the use of climate projections in facilities project designs—including identification of authoritative sources of such projections, use of projections involving multiple future scenarios, and what future time periods to consider. (Recommendation 8) We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to DOD and NOAA. In written comments, DOD concurred with all eight of our recommendations and identified actions it plans to take to address two of them. DOD’s comments are reprinted in their entirety in appendix II. DOD also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. NOAA did not provide any comments on the draft. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional addressees; the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force; and the Secretary of Commerce (for NOAA).

GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. Senate Report 115-130, accompanying a bill for fiscal year 2018 appropriations for military construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies, cited concerns with the frequency and costs of extreme weather events and the potential effects of climate change, and included a provision for us to review the Department of Defense’s (DOD) progress in developing a means to account for potentially damaging weather in its project designs. In response to this provision, we examined the extent to which DOD has taken steps to incorporate resilience to extreme weather and climate change effects into (1) installation master plans and related planning documents, and (2) individual installation facilities projects. For both of our objectives, we visited or requested information from a sample of domestic military installations. We focused on domestic installations because our November 2017 report focused on foreign installations. To develop this sample, we selected installations in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. territories that had identified one or more climate-related vulnerabilities, based on their past experiences, in a DOD-administered survey of climate vulnerabilities, or installations that were referenced in a prior GAO report on weather and climate risks at DOD installations. In addition to these criteria, we selected sites that represented both a diversity in types of climate vulnerabilities and geographic diversity among the military services, as well as installations involved in any climate change-related pilot studies. From these criteria, we developed a non-generalizable sample of 23 installations. We also included in the sample one Air Force unit (not an installation) with responsibilities for particular facilities of interest in Alaska, because these facilities presented a climatic vulnerability (accelerating coastal erosion) that was not necessarily included elsewhere in the sample. We visited 10 of these installations, as well as the Air Force unit in Alaska, in person. Within the sample, we selected installations to visit based on geographic diversity and installations in proximity to each other, allowing us to visit multiple installations on each trip. For the remaining 13 installations, we developed and administered a questionnaire and document request. We received responses from 12 of these installations. One installation—Camp Lejeune—sustained significant damage from Hurricane Florence in September 2018, and to minimize the burden on installation officials’ time to respond, we met with them by phone. Results from our nongeneralizable sample cannot be used to make inferences about all DOD locations. However, the information from these installations provides valuable insights. We asked similar questions to installations on our site visits and in the questionnaires, and we collected similar documents—such as installation master plans and individual facilities project documents— allowing us to report on similar information, such as the extent to which extreme weather and climate change considerations were integrated into installation master plans and individual facilities projects. For objective one, we reviewed DOD policies, guidance, and standards related to increasing climate resilience and conducting installation master planning. These documents included, among others, DOD Directive 4715.21, which establishes policy and assigns responsibilities for DOD to assess and manage risks associated with climate change; DOD’s Unified Facilities Criteria standard on installation master planning, which establishes the requirements for installation master plans; and a memorandum from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics on floodplain management on DOD installations. We interviewed officials in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment and the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program. We also interviewed officials in each of the military departments, including officials involved with installation policy, as well as officials from the engineering organizations of each military department and officials in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to discuss climate science and the data potentially available for planners to use. We reviewed documents from each of the 23 installations and the one Air Force unit in our sample, including master plans, and used interviews with installation officials and questionnaires received from installations to determine the extent to which the installations had incorporated consideration of extreme weather and climate change effects into their installation plans. We compared DOD’s actions to take steps in installation planning to increase resilience to extreme weather and climate change effects with DOD guidance on climate change adaptation and resilience, Unified Facilities Criteria standards, federal internal control standards, and best practices for enterprise risk management. For objective two, we reviewed DOD guidance, including DOD Directive 4715.21, requiring DOD components to integrate climate change considerations into DOD plans. We also reviewed DOD’s facilities project design standards—the Unified Facilities Criteria—to determine the extent to which installations incorporated requirements for climate resilience and to identify any required or recommended climate data sources for facilities project design. Specifically, we reviewed the 27 core Unified Facilities Criteria standards, as well as 3 other Unified Facilities Criteria standards outside of the core 27—because of their broad relevance to project design—and one facility criteria on Navy and Marine Corps design procedures. Additionally, we performed a content analysis of these criteria for references to climate, weather, environment, and any climate data to be used as a basis for facilities design. We also identified any required or recommended climate data sources or tools for facilities design by searching for references, web links, or tables related to climate data within the criteria. Where climate data sources were identified, we reviewed them to determine the extent to which the sources and tools involved historical data or climate projections that anticipate future climate conditions. We interviewed officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, and the Air Force Civil Engineer Center to understand the extent to which the Unified Facilities Criteria include guidance or data sources for adapting DOD facilities to extreme weather and climate change effects. In addition, we used interviews with installation officials and questionnaires we received from installations to determine the extent to which the installations had planned or executed any military construction or sustainment, restoration, and modernization facilities projects since 2013 that included any elements for building resilience to extreme weather or climate change effects. We then reviewed project documentation for proposed or approved facilities projects to identify the resilience measures taken. We also observed some facilities-related climate resilience measures adopted by these installations. In addition, we interviewed officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment to determine what plans, if any, the office had to update Unified Facilities Criteria with climate resilience requirements. We also interviewed officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment; the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations and Environment; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Installations, Environment and Energy to identify any actions, policies, or processes related to adapting facilities to extreme weather and climate change effects. Moreover, we interviewed officials from the American Society of Civil Engineers to understand what efforts, if any, had been made to incorporate climate projections into industry standards. Finally, we compared the extent to which DOD took steps in its facilities projects and its project design standards to increase resilience with DOD guidance on climate change resilience.

Federal laws establish minimum requirements nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including standards for the quality of care. These standards cover a variety of categories, such as resident rights, quality of care, and quality of life. In 2016, CMS finalized a comprehensive update to its nursing home standards to reflect new requirements and align requirements with current clinical practices, among other things. The changes were implemented in three phases, starting November 28, 2016. The federal government and the states share oversight responsibility for the nation’s nursing homes, with specific activities occurring at the national, regional, and state levels. CMS central office. At the national level, the CMS central office oversees the federal standards nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Primarily through its State Operations Manual, the office establishes the responsibilities of CMS’s regional offices and state survey agencies in ensuring that federal quality standards for nursing homes are met. CMS regional offices. CMS’s 10 regional offices oversee state activities and report back to the CMS central office the results of their efforts. Specifically, regional offices use the State Performance Standards System to evaluate state surveyors’ performance on factors such as the frequency and quality of state surveys. State survey agencies. Under agreement with CMS, a state survey agency in each state assesses whether nursing homes meet CMS’s standards, allowing them to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. State survey agencies assess nursing homes using (1) recurring standard surveys and (2) as-needed investigations. Standard surveys. State survey agencies are required by federal law to perform unannounced, on-site standard surveys of every nursing home receiving Medicare or Medicaid payment at least every 15 months, with a statewide average frequency of every 12 months. These surveys are a comprehensive assessment designed to determine whether nursing homes are complying with Medicare and Medicaid quality standards. Investigations. In addition to standard surveys, state survey agencies are required by federal law to investigate (1) complaints submitted by residents, family members, friends, physicians, and nursing home staff; and (2) “facility-reported incidents,” including incidents involving abuse of residents, that are self-reported by the nursing homes. State survey agencies review the information provided through these complaints and incidents and determine if an on-site investigation is required. During this unannounced investigation, the state surveyors assess available evidence to determine whether the allegation can be substantiated. These investigations offer the state survey agency the opportunity to identify and correct care problems in a more timely manner than through the standard surveys. If a surveyor determines that a nursing home violated a federal standard during a survey or investigation, then a deficiency code specific to that standard is cited. For instance, one deficiency code for abuse of residents encompasses mental/verbal, sexual, or physical abuse; while a few additional deficiency codes encompass abuse-related issues, such as a failure by the nursing home to train staff on issues related to abuse. Cited deficiencies are then classified into categories according to scope (the number of residents potentially affected) and severity (the potential for or occurrence of harm to residents). (See table 1.) State survey agencies are required to enter data about deficiencies into CMS’s survey database. For most deficiencies, the nursing home is required to prepare a plan of correction, and, depending on the scope and severity of the deficiency, surveyors may re-visit the facility to ensure that the nursing home has implemented its plan and corrected the deficiency. In any instances where surveyors substantiate the occurrence of resident abuse, the state survey agency is required to refer the case to three entities: 1) local law enforcement; 2) the MFCU, if appropriate; and 3) the state’s nurse aide registry or other applicable professional licensure authority. When nursing homes are cited with deficiencies, federal enforcement actions—or penalties—can be imposed to encourage homes to make corrections. In general, enforcement actions: (1) may be initially recommended by the state survey agency, (2) are transferred to the CMS regional office for review, (3) are imposed by the same CMS regional office, and (4) are implemented—that is, put into effect. Depending on the scope and severity of the deficiency cited, the CMS regional office may impose certain enforcement actions so that they are implemented immediately. However, for other enforcement actions, the regional office may provide the nursing home with an opportunity to correct the deficiencies, which, if corrected before the scheduled effective date, can result in the penalty not being implemented. Penalties include directed in- service training, fines known as civil money penalties, denial of payment, and termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, among others. (See fig. 1.) When a nursing home becomes aware of an incident of alleged resident abuse, the home must: immediately report the allegation to the state survey agency and then conduct an investigation of the alleged incident. Specifically, the process is as follows: The nursing home must immediately report alleged abuse to the state survey agency. After notifying the state survey agency, the nursing home is also required to conduct its own investigation and submit its findings in a written report to the state survey agency within 5 working days of the incident. Depending on the severity of the circumstances, the state survey agency may visit the nursing home to investigate the incident or wait until the nursing home submits its report. Depending on the content of the report, the state survey agency may request the home conduct additional work or the state survey agency may investigate further on its own. If the state survey agency opts not to investigate further, it may still review the manner in which the home conducted its investigation during the state survey agency’s next scheduled standard survey. If a state survey agency determines that a nurse aide is responsible for abuse, the agency must add this finding to the state’s nurse aide registry—a registry that each state is required to maintain that lists all individuals who have satisfactorily completed approved nurse aide training and a competency evaluation program in that state. Nursing homes are prohibited from employing a nurse aide with a finding of abuse on the nurse aide registry. Further, if there is a reasonable suspicion that a crime has occurred that results in serious bodily injury, federal law requires certain covered individuals at the nursing home to immediately report to law enforcement in addition to the state survey agency. Before employing a nurse aide, nursing homes are required to check each relevant state’s registry to verify that the nurse aide has passed a competency evaluation. All nursing homes must also verify with the relevant state board of licensing the professional credentials of the licensed personnel, such as registered nurses, whom they hire. In addition to state survey agencies, there are other state and local agencies that may be involved in investigating abuse in nursing homes. These other state and local agencies that investigate abuse in nursing homes are generally focused on the different aspects of the specific alleged abuse incident, in contrast to the state survey agency, which focuses on the safety of individual residents, as well as on the facility’s policies and procedures for preventing and effectively addressing abuse. These other state and local agencies include: Adult Protective Services. In some states, Adult Protective Services’ investigators are trained to provide protection and intervention for older adults in nursing homes and can play a valuable role in helping to protect residents from abuse. Ombudsmen. Long-term care ombudsmen, who serve as advocates for nursing home residents, may also investigate abuse complaints made by or on behalf of residents. Local law enforcement. Law enforcement may also play a role in investigating alleged nursing home resident abuse. Specifically, local police departments may learn of suspected instances of resident abuse and conduct criminal investigations. MFCU. The state MFCUs typically learn of abuse allegations through referrals from state survey agencies, which CMS requires if abuse is substantiated. If, after investigating an allegation, the MFCU decides that there is sufficient evidence to press criminal charges, it may prosecute the case itself or refer the matter to the state’s attorney general or a local prosecutor. Our analysis of CMS data found that from 2013 through 2017, abuse deficiencies cited in nursing homes became more frequent, with the largest increase in severe cases. While abuse deficiencies are relatively rare—they comprise less than 1 percent of the total deficiencies in each of the years we examined—they became more common over the 5-year period. Specifically, the number of abuse deficiencies cited more than doubled—from 430 in 2013 to 875 in 2017 (a 103.5 percent increase). This trend for the abuse deficiencies is in contrast to the trend for all deficiencies, which decreased about 1 percent between 2013 and 2017. At the state level, 32 states had more abuse deficiencies cited in 2017 than 2013, six states had a consistent number, and the remaining 13 had fewer. (See app. III for additional data on abuse deficiencies by state.) Furthermore, abuse deficiencies cited in 2017 were more likely to be categorized at the highest levels of severity—deficiencies causing actual harm to residents or putting residents in immediate jeopardy—than they were in 2013. Specifically, 42.6 percent of the 875 abuse deficiencies were categorized as causing actual harm or posing immediate jeopardy to residents in 2017, compared to 31.9 percent of the 430 abuse deficiencies in 2013. (See fig. 2.) In examining the types of survey or investigations conducted to identify abuse deficiencies, we found that, from 2013 to 2017, the majority (about two-thirds in each year) were identified through either a complaint investigation or facility-reported incident investigation. In contrast, for all types of deficiencies, we found the inverse—the vast majority were identified through a standard survey. This demonstrates the unique and significant role that complaint and facility-reported incident investigations have in identifying abuse deficiencies, because they allow for the identification and correction of abuse in a more timely manner than a standard survey. In fact, for the deficiencies for which we were able to identify the source, the percentage of abuse deficiencies identified through facility-reported incident investigations increased from 42.3 percent of the 430 abuse deficiencies in 2013 to 47.4 percent of the 875 abuse deficiencies in 2017. Conversely, for all types of deficiencies, a very small percentage resulted from facility-reported incident investigations—about 5 percent or less each year. (See fig. 3.) We found that enforcement actions—or penalties—were imposed and implemented by CMS infrequently each year in response to abuse deficiencies, and that fines were the most common type of implemented penalty. Specifically, for each year from 2013 through 2017, we found that about one-third of abuse deficiencies had an enforcement action imposed but not implemented, and less than 8 percent of abuse deficiencies had enforcement actions that were implemented against the nursing home. This was fairly consistent over the 5-year period. For example, in 2017, of the 875 abuse deficiencies cited, 275 (31.4 percent) resulted in enforcement actions that were imposed but not implemented and 65 (7.4 percent) had enforcement actions that were implemented against the nursing home. Furthermore, for abuse deficiencies cited at the most severe levels—that is, those causing actual harm or immediate jeopardy to residents—a smaller percentage of the deficiencies had an enforcement action imposed but not implemented compared to all abuse deficiencies, but a larger percentage were implemented. For example, in 2017, 373 of the 875 abuse deficiencies were cited at the most severe levels; of those, 81 (21.7 percent) resulted in enforcement actions that were imposed but not implemented, and 51 (13.7 percent) were implemented against the nursing home. Regardless of the severity, the predominant reason that CMS did not implement imposed enforcement actions was because the nursing home came into compliance prior to the implementation date of the penalty. For implemented enforcement actions, fines—known as civil money penalties—were overwhelmingly the most common type of penalty implemented against nursing homes with abuse deficiencies, increasing from 69.6 percent of the 23 abuse deficiencies with implemented enforcement actions in 2013 to 83.1 percent of the 65 in 2017. Denial of payments for new Medicare and Medicaid admissions—another financial penalty—was the second most common type of implemented enforcement action, but decreased from 34.8 percent in 2013 to 13.8 percent in 2017. Mandatory termination is the most severe enforcement action as it ends all payments for Medicare and Medicaid residents; it is implemented very rarely, with only one abuse deficiency resulting in mandatory termination of the nursing home across all 5 years. (See fig. 4.) In addition, we found the number of nursing homes with abuse deficiencies also more than doubled over the 5-year period. In 2013, 394 nursing homes (2.7 percent of all surveyed nursing homes) had at least one abuse deficiency compared to 821 nursing homes (5.6 percent of all surveyed nursing homes) in 2017. A nursing home may have more than one abuse deficiency cited in a single year, such as from a standard survey early in the year and then a complaint investigation later in the year. We found that in 2013, of the 394 nursing homes that had a total of 430 abuse deficiencies cited, 85 of the homes had two or more abuse deficiencies that year. In 2017, of the 821 nursing homes that had 875 total abuse deficiencies cited, 155 had two or more that year. Further, across the 5-year period, we found that a small proportion of all nursing homes with abuse deficiencies had them in multiple consecutive years. Specifically, across all years, 2,214 total unique nursing homes (13.6 percent of all surveyed nursing homes) had at least one abuse deficiency. A small portion of these nursing homes had at least one abuse deficiency in multiple consecutive years, indicating potential patterns in abuse at these nursing homes. Specifically, 185 of the 2,214 nursing homes with abuse deficiencies over the 5-year period—8.4 percent—had an abuse deficiency in any 2 consecutive years. In addition, 25 of the nursing homes—1.1 percent—had an abuse deficiency in 3 or more consecutive years. (See fig. 5.) Finally, we analyzed a selection of characteristics, including ownership type and bed size, for these nursing homes that had abuse deficiencies cited in multiple years and compared them to homes that had abuse deficiencies cited in a single year and surveyed homes that did not have any abuse deficiencies. We found that the nursing homes differed. For example, while for-profit organizations—the largest ownership group accounting for 67.9 percent of all surveyed nursing homes—owned 66.9 percent of nursing homes without any abuse deficiencies cited over the 5- year period, they accounted for 78.6 percent of nursing homes that had abuse deficiencies cited in 2 or more years. In addition, nursing homes designated as Special Focus Facilities—a CMS program that provides increased oversight to homes with consistent poor performance— constituted 2.5 percent of all surveyed nursing homes compared to 1.9 percent of nursing homes without abuse deficiencies and 10.1 percent of nursing homes with abuse deficiencies cited in 2 or more years. (See table 2.) Our analysis of a representative sample of CMS narrative descriptions— written by state surveyors—associated with abuse deficiencies cited in 2016 and 2017 found that physical and mental/verbal abuse occurred most often in nursing homes, followed by sexual abuse. Further, staff were more often the perpetrators of the deficiencies cited as abuse than were residents or others. (See fig. 6.) Physical abuse, which CMS defines as hitting, slapping, punching, biting and kicking residents, was present in about 46 percent (+/- 5 percent) of the abuse deficiency narratives. Mental/verbal abuse, which CMS defines as verbal or nonverbal conduct that can cause a resident to experience humiliation and fear, among other things, was present in about 44 percent (+/- 5 percent) of the abuse deficiency narratives. Sexual abuse, which CMS defines as non-consensual sexual contact with a resident, was present in about 18 percent (+/- 5 percent) of the abuse deficiency narratives. Staff, which includes those working in any part of the nursing home, were perpetrators in 58 percent (+/- 5 percent) of abuse deficiency narratives, followed by resident perpetrators (30 percent +/- 5 percent) and other types of perpetrators (2 percent +/- 5 percent). Other types of perpetrators can include family members of residents or other visitors. Further, our analysis of the narratives found that sexual abuse perpetrated by residents (39 percent) occurred more frequently within our sample than sexual abuse perpetrated by staff (10 percent) or others (17 percent). When staff were the perpetrators of abuse, we found within our sample that mental/verbal abuse was the most common type of abuse (60 percent), while physical abuse was most common in situations where residents (59 percent) or others (67 percent) were the perpetrators. For examples of the different types of abuse and perpetrators from our analysis, see table 3 below. Within our sample of narratives, mental/verbal abuse was less likely to be categorized by surveyors as severe compared to physical and sexual abuse. Specifically, we found in our sample that the proportion of mental/verbal abuse (30 percent) categorized by state surveyors as severe—defined as actual harm or immediate jeopardy—was smaller than the proportion of physical (40 percent) and sexual abuse (58 percent) categorized as severe. In addition, we found that most of the mental/verbal (88 percent), physical (91 percent), and sexual abuse (77 percent) narratives in our sample were categorized by surveyors as “isolated” in scope. Stakeholder groups in most of the five states we interviewed—including state survey agencies, Adult Protective Services, law enforcement, MFCUs, ombudsmen, and nursing home administrators and clinical staff—identified risk factors for abuse in nursing homes that included resident characteristics, such as residents with infrequent visitors, and nursing home staffing characteristics, such as insufficient staffing levels. (See table 4 for a description of these risk factors.) Officials we interviewed from national organizations with knowledge of abuse in nursing homes also noted some of these same risk factors. Resident characteristics. Stakeholders in each of our five selected states noted that residents who do not have frequent visitors, are cognitively impaired, or mixed with widely different age groups may be at an increased risk for abuse. Residents who do not have frequent visitors. Stakeholders in four of the five states said that residents without regular visitors, such as family, may be at an increased risk for abuse because regular visitors could notice and report potential warning signs of abuse, such as changes in their behavior or physical appearance. Residents who are cognitively impaired. Stakeholders in each of the five states said that cognitively impaired residents may be especially vulnerable to abuse because they often cannot speak or may have difficulty recalling recent events, and they are therefore less likely to be able to remember or describe what happened. In addition to noting that cognitively impaired residents may be at an increased risk of abuse, some stakeholders said that some cognitively impaired residents may be more likely to be perpetrators of abuse as their condition can have behavioral symptoms, such as physical aggressiveness. Residents mixed with widely different age groups. Stakeholders in four of the five states also noted that elderly nursing home residents who are mixed with widely differing age groups, such as young adults with mental illness, may be at a higher risk for incidents of abuse due to the different characteristics of these groups. Combining these two populations, which have differing needs, can also be challenging for staff. For example, staff may have more experience caring for elderly residents with complex needs, such as dementia, and they may not have the necessary skills or training to care for needs of younger residents, who require other types of complex care. This can create a stressful environment for staff, which is a risk factor for staff as potential perpetrators of abuse. Two stakeholders noted that younger residents who may have mental illness can have conflicts with older and frailer residents, potentially leading to abusive incidents between residents. Nursing home staffing characteristics. Stakeholders we interviewed in each of our five selected states noted that nursing homes with insufficient staffing, inadequate staff training, and inadequate staff screening may be at risk for abuse. Nursing homes with insufficient staff. Stakeholders in each of the five states said that nursing homes with insufficient staff may be at risk for abuse because there may not be enough staff attending to the needs of residents. Stakeholders noted that nursing homes have faced challenges hiring and retaining qualified staff and that, as a result, existing staff can feel overworked, stressed, or exhausted, which can lead to abusive behaviors. Staffing issues are not just risk factors for staff as perpetrators of abuse, but they can also limit a staff member’s ability to identify and report abuse. For example, insufficient staffing may mean that there are not enough available staff to notice signs of abuse in a timely fashion, such as noticing a resident’s bruises before they heal. Nursing homes with inadequate staff training on abuse. Inadequate staff training on abuse was noted by stakeholders we interviewed in four of the five states as a risk factor for abuse because; for example, staff may not know how to diffuse challenging situations with residents and identify and report abuse. As previously noted, recognizing abuse can be challenging and, even when abuse is identified, it is often not reported. Officials from all of the nursing homes that we visited said that they provide training to their staff on abuse, including on defining abuse, identifying or detecting different types of abuse, and reporting abuse. Staff members we spoke with at one nursing home said that, not only are they trained to look for physical signs of abuse, such as bruising, but they are also trained to observe changes in behavior that may be warning signs for abuse, such as a resident suddenly withdrawing from group activities. Staff at another nursing home said that they are also taught to ask another staff member for assistance when they are feeling frustrated or stressed by caring for a particular resident. In contrast, staff at another nursing home noted the challenges of not having these types of resources and said they are needed at their facility. Nursing homes with inadequate staff screening. Stakeholders in three of our five states said that inadequate staff screening can be a risk factor for abuse. Some stakeholders said that a thorough background screening can be time consuming. Further, because staff screening through background checks and the nurse aide registry is not coordinated across the country, there are gaps that could enable individuals who committed crimes in one state to obtain employment at a nursing home in another state, a concern that we previously reported. Staff from a nursing home we visited said the prevention of abuse “starts with hiring the right staff” and noted the importance of conducting background checks and checking references for prospective employees. The key challenges for abuse investigations most frequently identified by stakeholder groups in the five states we reviewed were underreporting of abuse, cognitive impairment of victims, lack of cooperation from nursing homes, and lack of agency coordination. (See table 5 for a description of these challenges.) Officials we interviewed from national organizations with knowledge of abuse in nursing homes also noted some of these same challenges. Underreporting of abuse. Stakeholders in each of the five states in our review noted that abuse in nursing homes may be underreported because residents or their families feel uncomfortable or fear retaliation from nursing home staff. For example, residents who were sexually abused may feel ashamed or embarrassed to report these incidents. In addition, residents may fear retaliation by the nursing home staff on whom they depend, which might include substandard care, exclusion from activities, or even eviction from the home. A fear of retaliation can also extend to nursing home staff, who may witness abuse by another staff member, but may be afraid to report it out of fear that they will lose their jobs or that they will face retaliation from co-workers. This underreporting creates challenges for investigators, who are unable to investigate if they do not know that abuse has occurred. Cognitive impairment of victims. Stakeholders in each of the five states in our review said that victims with cognitive impairment may not be able to give statements regarding the abuse or may not be considered reliable witnesses. For example, residents with dementia may not be able to remember the details of an abusive incident, and their memory of the details may deteriorate over the course of an investigation. Or, residents with dementia may report abuse that stems from traumatic memories from an incident that occurred earlier in their lives. One stakeholder said this can be a challenge for investigations because they do not know how much they can rely on a cognitively impaired resident’s statement, making it difficult for them to corroborate an abuse allegation. However, one stakeholder noted that, while it can be difficult to interview abuse victims with cognitive impairment, it is important to treat their allegations seriously and with credibility. One law enforcement stakeholder noted that interviews with these victims require special training. Lack of cooperation from some nursing homes. Stakeholders in each of the five states in our review said that some nursing homes may withhold, alter, or make it difficult for investigatory agencies to gain access to necessary, timely, or accurate information about alleged abuse. This may be, for example, because they may fear adverse publicity, litigation, or penalties from the state or CMS. In addition, as noted previously, nursing home staff may be fearful of losing their jobs. Stakeholders said that nursing home staff who witnessed abuse may be intentionally vague when interviewed by investigators; for example, by saying they cannot recall an incident. Some stakeholders also noted that nursing homes may delay investigators’ access to patient records, or they may even alter patient records in order to fill in information that should have been documented but was not at the time of the incident. One stakeholder we interviewed noted that the problem is not necessarily widespread—that some nursing homes are open about sharing information while others can be more difficult. Another stakeholder noted that a nursing home’s cooperation can sometimes depend on the seriousness of the allegation. Lack of agency coordination. Stakeholders in three of the five states in our review said that having multiple agencies involved in investigations, such as the state survey agency, law enforcement, the ombudsman, and, in some states, Adult Protective Services, can create challenges, including coordinating investigations and notifying one another about investigation outcomes. One stakeholder said they sometimes begin an investigation without realizing another investigatory agency has already started its own investigation. Further, stakeholders in two of the five states in our review said that CMS does not allow state survey agencies to share important investigatory information with law enforcement. (We discuss this issue in more detail later in this report.) We found that CMS: (1) cannot readily access data on the type of abuse or type of perpetrator, (2) has not provided guidance on what information nursing homes should include in facility-reported incidents, and (3) has numerous gaps in its referral process that can result in delayed and missed referrals to other entities. Together, these gaps affect critical points in CMS’s oversight of abuse in nursing homes including the prevention, identification, and timely investigation of abuse. CMS cannot readily access information on abuse or perpetrator type in its datasets and, as a result, lacks key information critical to understanding and appropriately addressing nursing home abuse with its oversight. Specifically, in two of CMS’s datasets—complaints/facility-reported incidents and deficiencies—agency officials told us they do not require the state survey agencies to record abuse and perpetrator type. As a result, we found that CMS’s data do not readily support CMS’s understanding of the types of abuse and perpetrators that are most prevalent in nursing homes. CMS officials told us they believe that the majority of abuse is committed by nursing home residents, and that physical and sexual abuse were the most common types; officials said they based this current understanding of abuse and perpetrator types on professional experience, literature, and ad hoc analyses of deficiency narrative descriptions. However, our review of a representative sample of abuse deficiency narratives from 2016 and 2017 found that staff were more often the perpetrators of deficiencies cited as abuse than residents or others, and that physical and mental/verbal abuse occurred most often in nursing homes, followed by sexual abuse. CMS officials noted that some incidents resulting from resident altercations—particularly those that do not show a willful intent to harm—may not have been cited as an abuse deficiency by some state survey agencies and may have been cited as other deficiencies not specified as abuse. This may have contributed to the difference between CMS’s understanding of the prevalence of resident to resident abuse and what their abuse deficiency data show. If CMS required information on abuse and perpetrator type to be recorded, the agency would have a better understanding of abuse in nursing homes. However, CMS officials told us they do not currently require the state survey agencies to specify abuse and perpetrator type because they consider the surveyor’s job to be identification and documentation of noncompliance. Additionally, CMS officials told us they have not conducted a systematic review to gather information on abuse and perpetrator type. This is inconsistent with federal internal control standards directing management to use quality information to achieve program objectives. Without the systematic collection and monitoring of specific abuse and perpetrator data, CMS lacks key information and, therefore, cannot take actions—such as tailoring prevention and investigation activities—to address the most prevalent types of abuse or perpetrators. All of the state survey agencies we spoke to told us that facility-reported incidents can lack key information that can cause potential delays in abuse investigations. Specifically, officials from each of the five state survey agencies told us that the facility-reported incidents they receive from nursing homes can lack key information that affects their ability to effectively triage incidents and determine whether an investigation should occur and how soon. Two state survey agencies we spoke with said they sometimes have to conduct significant follow-up with the nursing homes to obtain the information they need to prioritize the incident for investigation—follow-up that delays and potentially negatively affects investigations. For example, one state survey agency told us that a facility reported abuse involving two residents but did not initially report that the residents were injured, and that the facility did not file an addendum to the facility-reported incident to indicate resident injury. As a result of this incomplete information, the state survey agency did not properly prioritize this incident response. Despite federal law requiring nursing homes to self-report allegations of abuse, and covered individuals to report reasonable suspicions of crimes against residents, CMS has not provided guidance on what information should be included in these reports. Our review of CMS’s State Operations Manual found that CMS does not have guidance related to the information that nursing homes or covered individuals should report to the state survey agencies or local law enforcement; in contrast, it does contain guidance on the type of information members of the public should include in a complaint about nursing home quality to the state survey agency—and CMS makes a standardized complaint template form available on its website. The lack of guidance on the information that state survey agencies should collect on facility-reported incidents is inconsistent with federal internal control standards directing management to use quality information to achieve program objectives. CMS could outline basic information requirements that states must include on incident forms used by nursing homes and covered individuals to ensure the state survey agency is receiving the information it needs to accurately and quickly triage these incidents. CMS officials told us in November 2018 that they have efforts underway to examine guidance related to the information state survey agencies need to appropriately triage these facility-reported incidents and are developing a facility-reported incident template. Until the guidance and template are in place, these facility-reported incidents may lack key information that can cause potential delays in abuse investigations. CMS requires state survey agencies to make referrals to law enforcement and, if appropriate, to MFCUs when abuse is substantiated; however, we found numerous gaps in CMS’s referral process that can result in delayed and missed referrals. (See table 6.) Timing of abuse referrals. We found CMS’s requirements for when state survey agencies should report abuse to law enforcement and MFCUs lag behind the federal requirements for when covered individuals should make such referrals, and, as a result, referrals may be significantly delayed. Specifically, federal law requires covered individuals to immediately report reasonable suspicions of a crime against a resident that results in serious bodily injury to law enforcement and the state survey agency. Conversely, state survey agencies do not have to report suspicions of crime identified on complaints submitted to, and surveys conducted by, the state survey agency until the abuse has been substantiated—a process that can often take weeks or months. Officials from one law enforcement agency and two MFCUs that we interviewed told us the delay in receiving referrals limits their ability to collect evidence and prosecute cases—for example, bedding associated with potential sexual abuse may have been washed and wounds may have healed. This is consistent with the findings of our 2002 report, where we recommended that CMS should ensure that state survey agencies immediately notify law enforcement or MFCUs when nursing homes report allegations of physical or sexual abuse. One state survey agency in our review established more stringent guidelines than CMS by requiring the surveyors to notify law enforcement and the MFCU promptly upon receiving a complaint of abuse. CMS officials told us their state survey agency reporting requirements are based on a March 2002 policy. This is inconsistent with standards for internal control, which state that management should communicate quality information externally so that external parties can help the entity achieve its objectives. Tracking of abuse referrals. In addition to delays in referring cases to law enforcement and MFCUs, CMS officials also told us that CMS does not conduct oversight to ensure that state survey agency referrals to law enforcement and the MFCUs are occurring as required for substantiated abuse, and, as a result, CMS cannot ensure that state survey agencies are complying with reporting obligations. For example, an official from one of the five state survey agencies we interviewed said they had never made a referral to law enforcement or the MFCU, despite having substantiated allegations of abuse. The state survey agency official told us that they do not refer cases to law enforcement, and that law enforcement referrals are the responsibility of the nursing home. This is incompatible with CMS guidelines requiring that substantiated abuse be referred to law enforcement; however, CMS officials told us that they do not track whether state survey agencies make referrals to law enforcement and the MFCUs. This is inconsistent with federal standards for internal control, which state that management should establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control system and evaluate the results. Definition of substantiated abuse. We found confusion among some state survey agencies about CMS’s definition of what it means to substantiate an allegation of abuse—a challenge because substantiation is a trigger in the investigation process, and CMS requires state survey agencies to make referrals to law enforcement and staff registries when abuse is substantiated by evidence. As a result, there is a potential for substantiated abuse to not be reported and, subsequently, not referred to law enforcement or MFCUs for criminal investigation. Two of the five state survey agencies in our review told us they believed they could not substantiate an allegation unless they could also cite a federal deficiency. This is inconsistent with CMS’s guidance, which says that state survey agencies can substantiate that an allegation occurred without citing a federal deficiency and that, subsequently, these substantiated allegations must be referred to law enforcement and staff registries. For example, according to CMS guidance, if the state survey agency investigated and found evidence that a resident was abused, but the nursing home had taken preventive actions against the deficient practice, the state survey agency would then substantiate that the abuse occurred, but not cite a deficiency. However, state survey agencies may decide not to substantiate an abuse allegation verified by evidence if they believe no deficiency should be cited, such as if the nursing home had taken preventive action against the deficient practice, which could result in that abuse going unreported and not referred to law enforcement, MFCUs, or staff registries. Because substantiation of abuse is a critical trigger in abuse investigations, confusion around its interpretation could prevent these important next steps. CMS officials told us they are aware that the state survey agencies have varying interpretations of what it means to substantiate abuse. According to federal standards for internal control, management should internally communicate quality information to achieve the entity’s objectives. Information sharing. We also found that CMS’s guidance on state survey agency referrals contained in its State Operations Manual does not specify what incident information can be shared with local law enforcement, either in response to local law enforcement’s request for information or when the state survey agency refers substantiated findings of abuse to local law enforcement. As a result, both state survey and law enforcement agencies expressed confusion and frustration about what information can be shared and said delays have occurred that can impede law enforcement investigations. Officials from two state survey agencies told us that CMS does not allow them to share any information with law enforcement without a written request. For example, officials from one state survey agency said that they cannot share the name of the resident abused or the time when the incident occurred. One state survey agency said that information sharing can be uneven, and told us that law enforcement is required to share information with the state survey agencies, but the state survey agencies do not share their investigatory information with law enforcement. Officials from another state survey agency wrote to CMS notifying CMS of a change in their state survey agency protocol that would make the referral process timelier by providing un-redacted survey records of substantiated abuse to local law enforcement. However, in CMS’s 2017 written response to the survey agency, CMS told them that all written requests for these records must continue to be forwarded to CMS for processing in accordance with the federal Privacy Act. When we asked CMS officials what information state survey agencies can share with law enforcement in a referral, CMS explained that scenarios for requesting information can vary, and that CMS does not prescribe a specific method as it depends on the needs of the investigation. This lack of guidance is inconsistent with federal standards for internal control, which state that management should internally communicate quality information to achieve the entity’s objectives. While nursing home abuse is relatively rare, our review shows that abuse deficiencies cited in nursing homes are becoming more frequent, with the largest increase in severe cases. As such, it is imperative that CMS have key information critical to understanding abuse and that the agency’s oversight of nursing homes is strong. We found weaknesses in both CMS’s understanding of abuse and in its oversight that need to be addressed. Specifically, because CMS cannot readily access information on abuse or perpetrator types in its data, it lacks key information critical to taking appropriate actions to address the most prevalent types of abuse and perpetrators. In addition, CMS has not provided guidance on what information should be included in facility-reported incidents, contributing to a lack of information for state survey agencies and, subsequently, delays in their investigations. This lack of guidance related to facility- reported incidents is important in light of our findings that abuse deficiencies are identified most commonly through facility-reported incidents. We also found other gaps in CMS’s process related to ensuring timely referrals of abuse to law enforcement, tracking abuse referrals, defining abuse substantiation, and sharing information with law enforcement. These gaps affect CMS’s oversight of abuse in nursing homes—including the prevention, identification and timely investigation of abuse—and may limit CMS’s ability to ensure that nursing homes meet federal requirements for residents to be free from abuse. We are making the following six recommendations to the administrator of CMS: Require that abuse and perpetrator type be submitted by state survey agencies in CMS’s databases for deficiency, complaint, and facility- reported incident data, and that CMS systematically assess trends in these data. (Recommendation 1) Develop and disseminate guidance—including a standardized form—to all state survey agencies on the information nursing homes and covered individuals should include on facility-reported incidents. (Recommendation 2) Require state survey agencies to immediately refer complaints and surveys to law enforcement (and, when applicable, to MFCUs) if they have a reasonable suspicion that a crime against a resident has occurred when the complaint is received. (Recommendation 3) Conduct oversight of state survey agencies to ensure referrals of complaints, surveys, and substantiated incidents with reasonable suspicion of a crime are referred to law enforcement (and, when applicable, to MFCUs) in a timely fashion. (Recommendation 4) Develop guidance for state survey agencies clarifying that allegations verified by evidence should be substantiated and reported to law enforcement and state registries in cases where citing a federal deficiency may not be appropriate. (Recommendation 5) Provide guidance on what information should be contained in the referral of abuse allegations to law enforcement. (Recommendation 6) We provided a draft of this product to HHS for review and comment. In its comments, reproduced in appendix IV, HHS concurred with our six recommendations and identified actions it is taking to implement them. Specifically, HHS said that it will: (1) look into options for requiring state survey agencies to record data on abuse and perpetrator type so that HHS may assess trends in these data; (2) develop guidance that includes a list of standardized data elements to be included when nursing homes report facility-reported incidents and guidance specific to the reporting and tracking of facility-reported incidents involving abuse; (3) require state survey agencies to immediately refer complaints to law enforcement if a reasonable suspicion of a crime against a resident has occurred and share relevant survey information; (4) consider how to implement mechanisms for tracking law enforcement referrals; (5) identify opportunities to clarify in guidance situations where citing a federal deficiency may not be appropriate, but reporting the abuse is still required; and (6) develop a list of standardized elements that should be included when reporting an abuse allegation to law enforcement. HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.

GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. This appendix describes our scope and methodology for determining the trends and types of abuse occurring in nursing homes in recent years. For this examination, we reviewed CMS guidance and analyzed data from 2013 through 2017, which represented the most recent data for a 5-year period at the time of our review. Specifically, we first reviewed the CMS State Operations Manual’s Appendix PP that was in effect during our period of review to determine which federal standards and deficiency codes were relevant to resident abuse. We focused our analysis on the deficiency code to be used by state surveyors when a nursing home fails to keep a resident free from abuse, which encompasses mental/verbal, sexual, or physical abuse. Surveyors can also use other deficiency codes for abuse-related issues, such as a failure by the nursing home to train staff on issues related to abuse, either in conjunction with an abuse deficiency or without an abuse deficiency. Since these abuse-related deficiency codes do not necessarily represent incidents of abuse, but do represent situations where a nursing home’s inadequate policies could leave residents vulnerable to abuse, we conducted a limited analysis on the trends of these deficiencies, which is described in appendix II. For our analysis, we identified abuse deficiencies cited by surveyors in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., between 2013 and 2017, using data provided by CMS from its Certification and Survey Provider Enhanced Reports system. Specifically, we calculated the number of abuse deficiencies cited each year and determined how many of these abuse deficiencies were at each level of severity—no actual harm with a potential for minimal harm, no actual harm with a potential for more than minimal harm, actual harm, and immediate jeopardy—for each year. We compared the results for abuse deficiencies with the results for all types of deficiencies in each year. To avoid over-counting deficiencies, deficiencies that were for the same violation on the same day for the same facility were counted as a single deficiency. We then tracked (1) the origin of these abuse deficiencies and (2) enforcement actions implemented against nursing homes with these abuse deficiencies. Origin of abuse deficiencies. To identify trends in the origin of those abuse deficiencies—that is, whether the deficiency originated from a standard survey, complaint investigation, or a facility-reported incident investigation—we analyzed data provided by CMS from its Automated Survey Processing Environment Complaint/Incident Tracking System. Specifically, we matched the deficiencies with the complaint/incident data using provider number, survey date, and deficiency code. We found that some deficiencies were the result of a combination of complaints, facility-reported incidents, surveys, or all three. We counted those deficiencies as originating from each relevant category. Enforcement actions. To identify trends in the enforcement actions imposed and implemented against nursing homes with abuse deficiencies, we analyzed data provided by CMS from its Automated Survey Processing Environment Enforcement Manager. Specifically, we matched the deficiencies with the enforcement data using provider number, survey date, case identification number, and deficiency code. To avoid over-counting, deficiencies that share the same code and case identification number were counted as a single deficiency. For each year, we determined how many of the abuse deficiencies resulted in enforcement actions imposed or implemented, the severity of the abuse deficiencies with enforcement actions, and the types of enforcement actions implemented. We then examined these abuse deficiencies to determine the number of nursing homes that had abuse deficiencies, as well as the number of homes with repeated abuse deficiencies cited across the 5 years and the characteristics of those homes. We also determined the proportion of surveyed nursing homes in a given year that had an abuse deficiency. Nursing homes that had repeated abuse deficiencies. Since a nursing home can have more than one abuse deficiency cited in a given year, we determined the number of surveyed nursing homes each year that had at least one abuse deficiency, both nationally and by state. For each of those nursing homes, we determined if the home had an abuse deficiency repeated in multiple years and in two or more consecutive years. Nursing home characteristics. We attempted to identify commonalities among homes with multiple years of abuse deficiencies, homes with only a single year with an abuse deficiency, and surveyed homes without any abuse deficiencies throughout the 5- year period. Specifically, we matched deficiency data to CMS’s publicly available Provider of Services files and the Nursing Home Compare Provider Information files for each nursing home; and we examined bed size, non-profit or for-profit status, Five-Star Quality Rating System overall rating, Special Focus Facility designation, and urban or rural location. Finally, because abuse and perpetrator type are not readily identifiable in CMS’s data, we identified this information by reviewing the narratives written by surveyors that describe the substantiated abuse. Specifically, we obtained 1,557 narrative descriptions written by state surveyors for abuse deficiencies cited in 2016 and 2017 provided by CMS from its Automated Survey Processing Environment database. From that universe of abuse deficiency narratives, we selected a randomly selected representative sample of 400 narratives, and each narrative was reviewed by two separate reviewers who independently analyzed the text of each narrative to determine the abuse and perpetrator type according to the definitions that CMS implemented on November 28, 2017, in its State Operations Manual. Any disagreements between the two reviewers were resolved by a third independent reviewer. (See table 7.) For those narratives where the abuse type could not reasonably be categorized under an existing CMS definition, reviewers had the option to mark narratives as “other.” Furthermore, we analyzed the scope and severity for each narrative within our sample. CMS’s abuse deficiency code also included involuntary seclusion in the time period we examined and is defined in its November 22, 2017, guidance as “separation of a resident from other residents or from her/his room or confinement to her/his room (with or without roommates) against the resident’s will, or the will of the resident representative.” Our analysis of the narrative descriptions found that 3 percent of the abuse deficiency narratives in our sample were attributable to involuntary seclusion. We were unable to categorize the abuse and perpetrator type for about 11 percent of the deficiency narratives in our sample, because we determined the narrative description did not meet CMS’s abuse definition. We assessed the reliability of each of the datasets by checking for missing values and obvious errors and discussed them with CMS officials who were knowledgeable about the data. In the course of this assessment, we found some data limitations. Specifically, CMS officials told us that some state survey agencies may not have entered all facility- reported incidents into the Automated Survey Processing Environment Complaint/Incident Tracking System, while other state survey agencies did. We also found underreporting, as noted in our 2019 report, where the Oregon state survey agency was not entering all abuse-related complaints or facility-reported incidents into this same database—a problem that could exist in other states. In addition, CMS officials told us that it is possible there are additional incidents that may not have been represented in the abuse deficiency data during the period of our review. Specifically, CMS officials noted that some incidents resulting from resident altercations—particularly those that do not show a willful intent to harm—may not be cited as an abuse deficiency by some state survey agencies. We therefore consider the number of abuse deficiencies that resulted from complaints or facility-reported incidents to be a conservative estimate. After reviewing the possible limitations of these data, we determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this reporting objective. This appendix describes trends in abuse-related deficiencies over the 5- year period from 2013 through 2017. We reviewed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) guidance that was in effect during this period of review to determine which federal standards and deficiency codes were relevant to resident abuse. For the report, we focused our analysis on the deficiency code cited when state surveyors substantiate incidents of abuse, but there are also deficiencies that surveyors can cite for abuse-related issues, such as a failure by the nursing home to train staff on issues related to abuse, either in conjunction with an abuse deficiency or without an abuse deficiency. Since these abuse-related deficiencies do not necessarily represent incidents of abuse, but do represent situations where a nursing home’s inadequate policies could leave residents vulnerable to abuse, we also conducted a limited analysis on the trends of these deficiencies. Specifically, we analyzed CMS data to identify the number of abuse-related deficiencies cited in each year in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and determined how many were cited at each level of severity—no actual harm with a potential for minimal harm, no actual harm with a potential for more than minimal harm, actual harm, and immediate jeopardy. We also tracked the source of these abuse-related deficiencies—that is, whether the deficiency originated from a standard survey, complaint investigation, or a facility-reported incident investigation. Finally, we compared the results for abuse-related deficiencies with the results for all types of deficiencies cited by surveyors in each year. From 2013 to 2017, we found that abuse-related deficiencies became slightly more common with a resulting increase in severity. Specifically, abuse-related deficiencies increased by about 9.9 percent over the 5-year period, from 4,899 deficiencies cited in 2013 to 5,383 deficiencies cited in 2017, but peaked in 2016 with 5,687 deficiencies. This increasing trend for abuse-related deficiencies is in contrast to the slight decrease in all deficiencies cited over the same period, but not nearly as high as the 103.5 percent increase in abuse deficiencies. In addition, the proportion of abuse-related deficiencies cited at the highest levels of severity— deficiencies causing actual harm to residents or putting residents in immediate jeopardy—fluctuated throughout the 5-year period. Specifically, about 6.1 percent of the 4,899 abuse-related deficiencies in 2013, about 5.6 percent of the 5,278 abuse-related deficiencies in 2015, and about 7.8 percent of the 5,383 abuse-related deficiencies in 2017 caused actual harm or immediate jeopardy. (See fig. 7.) We also found that over half of the abuse-related deficiencies each year were cited by surveyors as a result of standard surveys, and the rest were cited by surveyors as a result of either complaint or facility-reported incident investigations. This falls between what we found for abuse deficiencies—the majority were a result of either complaint or facility- reported incident investigations—and all types of deficiencies—the vast majority were a result of standard surveys. Over the 5 years, similar to abuse deficiencies and all types of deficiencies, the percentage of abuse- related deficiencies that resulted from standard surveys decreased while the percentage that resulted from both complaint and facility-reported incident investigations increased. Specifically, over the 5-year period, the percentage of abuse-related deficiencies resulting from standard surveys decreased by about 8.8 percentage points, complaint investigations increased by about 3.6 percentage points, and facility-reported incident investigations increased by about 5.3 percentage points. (See fig. 8.) Tables 8 and 9 provide state-level data on abuse deficiencies and the nursing homes that had abuse deficiencies cited in consecutive years. John E.

The treatment and disposal of mixed HLW at INL is governed by a number of federal laws that define the roles of federal agencies and states in managing mixed HLW, as well as cleanup agreements among DOE, the state of Idaho, and other parties. DOE primarily regulates radioactive components of HLW under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended. These acts define HLW as (1) the highly radioactive waste material resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, including liquid waste produced directly in reprocessing and any solid material derived from such liquid waste that contains fission products in sufficient concentrations, and (2) other highly radioactive material that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission determines by rule, consistent with existing law, requires permanent isolation. DOE considers calcine waste HLW because it is solidified liquid waste produced during the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. EM manages the SBW as mixed HLW because, according to reports from DOE and National Academies, (1) the SBW was produced in the later stages of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, (2) the tanks in which the SBW is stored previously held HLW, (3) the SBW is stored in a location at INL where waste is managed as HLW, and (4) the waste contains hazardous chemicals subject to RCRA and EPA’s implementing regulations or authorized state programs that operate in lieu of the federal program. HLW must be disposed of in a geologic repository unless the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves an alternative disposal site. DOE Order 435.1 and Manual 435.1-1 describe the department’s policy and requirements for managing DOE’s radioactive waste, including HLW, to ensure that it is managed in a manner that is protective of worker and public health and safety and the environment. Manual 435.1-1 also established processes to determine whether waste resulting from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel can be managed as transuranic waste or low-level waste if certain criteria are met, which is referred to as a determination that the waste is incidental to reprocessing. According to the manual, HLW is waste incidental to reprocessing if, among other things, the waste has been processed, or will be processed, to remove key radionuclides to the maximum extent technically and economically practicable. Hazardous components of mixed HLW are regulated by EPA or authorized states under RCRA. EPA’s regulations require hazardous waste to meet certain treatment standards before land disposal of the waste unless a variance is granted. The regulations specify that the treatment standard (i.e., the required method for treatment) for Idaho’s mixed HLW is vitrification—the immobilization of waste in glass. Where EPA has authorized states to implement hazardous waste management programs, those state programs operate instead of the federal program. EPA, under RCRA, has authorized the state of Idaho to administer its own hazardous waste management program. EPA has also authorized New Mexico to administer its own hazardous waste management program. Pursuant to such authorization, New Mexico’s Environment Department issues the permit for hazardous waste storage and disposal at WIPP under the New Mexico Hazardous Waste Act. As of March 2019, EM’s IWTU reengineering project was in phase two of the four-phased approach to get the facility operational, according to EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials. According to project reports, phase one focused on identifying fixes to resolve problems with the facility’s equipment and waste treatment process, for example, by performing engineering analyses and chemistry studies. Phase two has focused on implementing these fixes, for example, by modifying a piece of equipment that separates solidified waste before it is moved to storage canisters, according to the contractor’s project plan. Figure 1 summarizes the four- phased approach for the IWTU reengineering project. According to EM documents, as of February 2019 total expenditures on phases one and two were approximately $150 million, about $64 million more than original costs estimated for those two phases combined, and the project was over 1 year behind schedule. Phase two has taken longer and cost more than initially estimated because of additional problems and required modifications to the facility as the work has progressed, according to EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials. Appendix II provides information on the actual costs of phases one and two compared to estimated costs. As previously noted, EM officials with the Idaho Cleanup Project estimated in March 2019 that phase three may begin in summer 2019. Further, these officials stated that phase three will involve a 6- month outage to continue implementing changes to the facility prior to the start of a 60-day performance test using a simulated waste form. EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials stated that phase four could begin in early 2020 and that EM and Fluor Idaho had yet to determine whether an outage would need to occur before starting testing with a small amount of the SBW. EM divides its cleanup work into capital asset projects and operations activities, two types of activities governed by different applicable project management policies: Capital asset projects. DOE Order 413.3B governs EM’s program and project management activities for the acquisition of capital assets, with the stated goal of delivering fully capable projects within the planned cost, schedule, and performance baseline. The order establishes five critical decision points of project development that each end with a major approval milestone that cover the life of a project. The order specifies requirements that must be met, including developing and managing project cost and schedule estimates to move a project past each critical decision milestone. EM capital asset projects include construction projects and cleanup projects, such as soil and water remediation and facility decommissioning and demolition. Operations activities. Operations activities are recurring facility or environmental operations, as well as activities that are project-like, with defined start and end dates, according to EM policy. EM operations activities include operating waste processing facilities and the stabilization, packaging, transportation, and disposition of nuclear waste. EM manages operations activities based on requirements listed in a cleanup policy that it issued in July 2017. In February 2019, we found that EM cleanup site managers have discretion in how to classify cleanup work because DOE and EM have not established requirements on what work should be managed as an operations activity under EM’s cleanup policy or as a capital asset project under DOE Order 413.3B. Further, we found that operations activities have less stringent management requirements than capital asset projects. We recommended that EM establish requirements for classifying work as an operations activity and revise its cleanup policy to follow program and project management leading practices. DOE generally agreed with our recommendations. Beginning in January 2005, EM managed the development and construction of the IWTU facility as a capital asset project. Once EM determined that construction on the facility was complete in April 2012, the project exited the capital asset oversight process established in DOE Order 413.3B and has since been managed as an operations activity, according to EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials. DOE officials also told us that the IWTU reengineering project has been managed as an operations activity because the facility has been constructed and is now in a period of maintenance and repair. Figure 2 shows a picture of the exterior of the IWTU facility. In August 2016, DOE’s Deputy Secretary of Energy issued a memorandum establishing a new oversight requirement for selected projects for which an extended period of transition to operations is likely— the phase after construction is complete but before full operational capability is attained—called the operational release milestone. According to the memorandum, DOE created the operational release milestone in the department’s project life cycle to provide additional oversight after the completion of the project under DOE’s Order 413.3B. DOE officials from the Office of Project Management stated that the operational release milestone was largely created in response to EM’s experience with the IWTU facility not operating as expected. Under these new requirements, program offices are to provide DOE’s Project Management Risk Committee (PMRC) with regular updates on selected projects until full operational capability of each facility is attained. Specifically, program offices are required to (1) develop and execute a plan that describes how the program will reach operational capability, which is referred to as an operational release plan, and (2) provide progress updates to the PMRC on the project, as described below. Operational release plan. Officials from DOE’s Office of Project Management—which serves as the secretariat for the PMRC—stated that the purpose of the operational release plan is for the program office to describe what steps are required for the project to reach its operational capability. According to EM’s guidance, the operational release plan should present the key processes, activities, interrelationships, risks, management and oversight, decision milestones and approvals, and overall schedule to achieve operational release. Progress updates. According to the memorandum and the PMRC’s standard operating procedures, program offices are to provide the PMRC with quarterly progress updates on selected projects, including lessons learned, until full operational capability is attained. The GAO’s cost guide and schedule guide compiled best practices corresponding to the characteristics of high-quality and reliable cost and schedule estimates. According to the cost guide, a high-quality, reliable cost estimate has four characteristics: comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible. A comprehensive cost estimate has enough detail to ensure that cost elements are neither omitted nor double-counted. If a cost estimate is not comprehensive (that is, complete), then it cannot fully meet the other characteristics (i.e., well-documented, accurate, or credible). In addition, according to the schedule guide, a high-quality, reliable schedule has four characteristics: comprehensive, well- constructed, controlled, and credible. A comprehensive schedule captures all government and contractor activities necessary to accomplish a project’s objectives, and a well-constructed schedule sequences all activities using the most straightforward logic possible. If a schedule is not comprehensive, with all activities accounted for, it is uncertain whether all activities are scheduled in the correct order, resources are properly allocated, missing activities will appear on the critical path, or a schedule risk analysis can account for all risk. If a schedule is not well-constructed, it will not be able to properly calculate dates and predict changes in the future, among other things. EM has not fully followed selected project management best practices for cost and schedule estimates for the IWTU reengineering project. EM generally followed best practices for a reliable EVM system to measure the performance of the reengineering project. However, in analyzing IWTU reengineering project data from March 2017 through February 2018, we found that the system is producing unreliable data, which may limit EM’s ability to measure the project’s performance. Further, EM has taken some steps toward meeting requirements under DOE’s process for monitoring projects with start-up risks. EM has not fully followed (i.e., has partially met) selected best practices in developing the cost and schedule estimates we reviewed for phases one and two of the IWTU reengineering project and future planned IWTU operations. We made the following observations based on our analysis of these cost estimating documents and a March 2018 project schedule: Comprehensive cost estimate (partially met): EM partially met best practices for a comprehensive cost estimate. According to our cost guide, a comprehensive cost estimate should reflect the project’s technical requirements and current schedule and account for all possible costs. While the cost estimate was based on documented technical information, it was not based on a standardized work breakdown structure. Without a standard, product-oriented work breakdown structure to facilitate the tracking of resource allocations and expenditures, EM may not be able to reliably estimate the cost of future similar programs. While assumptions are listed in EM’s documents describing the cost estimates, no document discusses whether the assumptions came from inputs from technical subject matter experts or whether the assumptions are associated with specific risks. Since assumptions are best guesses, best practices state that the risk associated with any of these assumptions changing need to be identified and assessed. Further, the IWTU reengineering project’s cost estimate was not complete because it did not account for all possible costs. According to our cost guide, a life cycle cost estimate provides an exhaustive and structured accounting of all resources and associated cost elements required to develop, produce, deploy, and sustain a particular program. The project’s cost estimate did not reflect all life cycle costs, in part because estimates for phases three and four of the project had not been developed at the time of our review. Best practices state that all costs be included in an estimate, even in early stages, such as at a rough order of magnitude. EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project said that a cost estimate was not developed for the total cost of the IWTU reengineering project because of the approach for negotiating the cost and schedule baseline prior to the start of each phase. Without developing a cost estimate for the IWTU reengineering project that is comprehensive (e.g., accounts for all possible costs), EM will not have reasonable assurance that it can successfully plan program resource requirements. Well-constructed schedule estimate (partially met): EM partially met best practices for a well-constructed schedule. According to our schedule guide, a well-constructed schedule includes activities that are logically sequenced; a valid critical path; and a reasonable amount of total float, meaning an accurate reflection of the schedule’s flexibility. EM’s March 2018 schedule had minimal sequencing issues and a continuous critical path, with the exception of an external dependency, and the critical path was free of lags and constraints. However, there were long duration activities on the critical path that should be reevaluated to determine if they can be broken into more manageable pieces. Without a valid critical path, management cannot focus on activities that will detrimentally affect the key program milestones and deliveries if they slip. Additionally, the schedule estimate included unreasonably large values of positive and negative float. According to best practices, a schedule should identify reasonable values of float so that the schedule’s flexibility can be determined to help accommodate for delays. EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project explained that the amount of total float was a result of the methods they used to structure the logic of the schedule estimate, which according to our best practices may have caused the schedule to be overly optimistic. According to scheduling best practices, without accurate values of total float, the schedule cannot be used to identify activities that could be permitted to slip and thus release and reallocate resources to activities that require more resources to be completed on time. Inaccurate values of total float also falsely depict true program status, which could lead to decisions that may jeopardize the program. In addition, the March 2018 schedule contained 14 activities with large amounts of negative float, meaning that these activities were behind schedule. Without fully developing a well-constructed schedule estimate for the IWTU reengineering project, EM will not have reasonable assurance that it can successfully achieve its plans to reengineer the IWTU and begin treatment of the SBW without further delays. Comprehensive schedule estimate (substantially met): EM substantially met best practices for a comprehensive schedule. According to our schedule guide, a comprehensive schedule includes all activities for both the government and its contractors to accomplish their objective, assigns resources (e.g., labor and materials) to all activities, and establishes how long each activity will take. EM’s March 2018 schedule substantially captured all activities, but it may not have been planned to the level of detail for the work necessary to accomplish a program’s objectives as defined in the program’s work breakdown structure. For example, the schedule had activities that were described as level of effort but were not assigned the level of effort activity type. Level of effort activities represent effort that has no measurable output and, according to best practices, should be clearly marked so they do not interfere with the critical path. Further, the schedule substantially met the best practice of assigning resources to all activities. For example, the schedule assigned resources to specific materials and equipment as well as to travel, training, and labor. Appendix II contains the full results of our analysis of selected best practices for the cost and schedule of the IWTU reengineering project. As previously noted, EM is managing the IWTU reengineering project as an operations activity. We reported in February 2019 that EM manages operations activities using less stringent requirements than those used for capital asset projects, posing cost and schedule risks. For example, under EM’s 2017 cleanup policy, there is no requirement for operations activities to follow best practices for cost estimates developed during contract execution. We recommended that EM review and revise its 2017 cleanup policy to include project management leading practices related to scope, cost, schedule performance, and independent reviews. DOE concurred with our recommendation and stated that EM was already in the process of reviewing its policy for necessary updates, revisions, and modifications, and that EM would consider our recommendation, as appropriate, during this process. EM officials with the Idaho Cleanup Project acknowledged that they do not have an estimate for the total cost or a completion date for the IWTU reengineering project or a schedule for when waste treatment operations will begin and be completed. An EM Idaho Cleanup Project official told us that Fluor Idaho submitted cost and schedule estimates for phases three and four of the reengineering project in January 2019 and that EM requested an independent cost estimate for this work from the Defense Contract Audit Agency, with contract negotiations between EM and Fluor Idaho for these phases estimated to begin in spring 2019. In addition, EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project acknowledged that a schedule for waste treatment operations at the project has not been developed. Further, these officials noted that design modifications to the IWTU are expected to reduce its operating capability, lengthening the time needed to treat the SBW. As a result, EM and Fluor Idaho plan to renegotiate the cost of their contract related to the treatment of the waste in the project, according to EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials. Specifically, because of the modifications to the project, the rate at which the SBW is treated will be slower than initially estimated, according to EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project. Treatment of all 900,000 gallons of the SBW was originally estimated to be completed in 10 months, but agency officials now estimate that treatment may take from 3 to 7 years— as much as eight times longer than originally planned. As previously noted, EM has already experienced approximately $64 million in added costs and, as of February 2019, a delay of over 1 year. Without fully following best practices for a comprehensive cost estimate and well- constructed schedule estimate for SBW waste treatment operations, EM cannot be assured that it has reliable cost and schedule estimates for decision-making, placing it at risk of continued cost overruns and delays in achieving its plans to reengineer the IWTU and begin treatment of the SBW. We analyzed IWTU reengineering project data for March 2017 through February 2018 from EM’s EVM system and found that while EM has followed (i.e., fully met or substantially met) some best practices for a reliable EVM system, the system is producing unreliable data. These unreliable data may limit EM’s ability to measure the project’s performance. EVM is a management tool used to measure the value of work accomplished in a given period and compare it with the planned value of work scheduled for the same period and with the actual cost of the work accomplished. EVM data can alert project managers to potential problems sooner than expenditures alone can, and EVM’s use as a management tool is considered a best practice for conducting cost and schedule performance analysis for projects, according to our cost guide. EM requires the use of an EVM system under its contract with Fluor Idaho for the Idaho Cleanup Project. Overall, we found that EM followed best practices to ensure that its EVM data for the IWTU reengineering project were (1) comprehensive and (2) used by leadership for decision-making. However, EM did not follow (i.e., partially met) best practices to ensure that the data resulting from the EVM system are reliable. Specifically: EM substantially met best practices for a comprehensive EVM system by, for example, requiring the contractor’s EVM system to comply with the guidelines established by the Earned Value Management Systems EIA-748-D Intent Guide; EM conducted a compliance review of Fluor Idaho’s EVM system in March 2017 and found some areas in need of improvement. In addition, EM has an EVM surveillance system in place under its contract with Fluor Idaho, and EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project stated that they review data from the EVM system each month. EM substantially met best practices ensuring that leadership uses the EVM data for decision-making. For example, Fluor Idaho updated data in its EVM system monthly during the period we reviewed, and EM reported issues in a monthly review briefing between EM and the contractor, according to EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials. Agency management also tracked the causes of cost and schedule variances in the data. However, the monthly reports did not contain all the information that best practices recommended. Specifically, the performance measurement baseline was not included in the contractor performance reports provided, so we could not determine how the performance measurement baseline changed as the project evolved. EM partially met best practices ensuring that the EVM system provides reliable data because, for instance, the system contained numerous anomalies, leading the system to produce unreliable data. Specifically, we found one or more anomalies present in all months of data reviewed, such as missing or negative values. While EM was able to explain the causes for most of these anomalies, negative values should occur rarely, if ever, in EVM reporting because they imply the undoing of previously scheduled or performed work. According to best practices, all anomalies should also be identified and the reason for each should be fully explained in EM’s monthly EVM reports. However, EM did not document the reasons for these anomalies in its monthly reports. EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project said that most of the anomalies in the data were due to the phase two estimate including authorized unpriced work—that is, additional work that EM agreed to let the contractor perform without first negotiating or independently verifying the costs. If errors in EVM reports are not detected, then EVM data will be skewed, resulting in bad decision-making and limiting EM’s ability to use the EVM system to measure project performance. Appendix III provides detailed information on EM’s performance on each EVM best practice. An EVM system that produces unreliable data may contribute to EM’s challenges in measuring the performance of its operations activities. Our findings in this regard are consistent with our prior reports examining EM’s use of EVM systems in other contracts. For example, in February 2019 we reviewed the use of EVM systems in the 21 contracts EM uses to execute its operations activities, including Fluor Idaho’s contract for the cleanup at INL, and found that EM has not followed best practices to ensure that these systems (1) are comprehensive, (2) provide reliable data, and (3) are used by EM leadership for decision-making. We recommended that EM update its cleanup policy to require that EVM systems be maintained and used in a way that follows EVM best practices, such as ensuring the reliability of the data in the system. Without following best practices for ensuring EVM data reliability for the IWTU reengineering project’s EVM system, EM leadership may not have access to reliable performance data with which to make informed decisions as it manages billions of dollars’ worth of cleanup work and provides information to Congress and other stakeholders on the cleanup work every year. In 2016, DOE instituted independent review requirements to monitor facilities with commissioning or start-up risks, and EM has taken some steps toward meeting those requirements for the IWTU reengineering project. As previously noted, DOE’s policy requires program offices to (1) develop and execute an operational release plan and (2) provide progress updates to the PMRC on the project each quarter. We made the following observations on EM’s actions to meet these requirements for the reengineering of the IWTU project: EM developed an operational release plan for the IWTU project in December 2016, which preceded EM’s developing guidance for these plans. We found that the operational release plan included the majority of elements that EM’s guidance later required. EM has provided five progress update briefings to the PMRC on the IWTU reengineering project, according to DOE documents, but these briefings have not occurred each quarter as required by DOE’s policy. Officials from DOE’s Office of Project Management told us that briefings generally occur when progress has been made on a project. EM’s guidance for operational release plans also states, with regard to progress update briefings, that an alternate reporting schedule may be proposed for PMRC approval. The PMRC made recommendations in three of these five briefings. For example, the PMRC recommended that EM revisit and review documents to ensure that the delegated authority is clear, current, and appropriate prior to facility start-up and the introduction of radioactive materials. According to documentation prepared following EM’s most recent briefing to the PMRC in February 2019, the PMRC recommended an update on the project in July 2019. Based on our review of EM documentation and plans, the agency does not have a strategy or timeline to address its three main challenges for disposing of the SBW or for identifying an alternative disposal pathway. EM identified WIPP as its preferred disposal site for the SBW in a 2005 Record of Decision document, but in March 2019 EM officials told us that a final decision on the disposal path for the SBW had not been made. The three main challenges EM faces in its plan to dispose of the SBW at its preferred disposal site are: (1) the permit for WIPP prohibits the SBW from being disposed of at WIPP, (2) federal law prohibits HLW from being disposed of at WIPP, and (3) there are existing capacity limitations to disposal at the WIPP facility. EM has taken some steps to address these challenges, as discussed further below. WIPP permit’s prohibition of the disposal of certain tank waste. New Mexico amended its permit for WIPP in 2004 to prohibit waste that has ever been managed as HLW, including the SBW at INL, from being disposed at WIPP unless the disposal of such waste is specifically approved through a permit modification. In 2013, DOE and its contractor responsible for operating and managing the facility filed a request with the state of New Mexico to modify the WIPP permit to remove this prohibition, which could allow the SBW to be disposed of at WIPP if EM determined that the SBW is waste incidental to reprocessing. However, the process was put on hold following the suspension of operations at WIPP in 2014, according to officials from DOE’s Carlsbad Field Office and New Mexico’s Environment Department. In April 2019, officials from New Mexico’s Environment Department said that they anticipated holding discussions with DOE and its contractor for the facility regarding the prohibition after the renewal of the WIPP permit in July 2020. However, a representative from a New Mexico environmental organization said that this proposed modification would likely face strong public opposition. This representative noted that previous DOE attempts to expand the types of waste that could be disposed of at WIPP caused significant public concern in New Mexico. Further, New Mexico Environment Department officials told us that processing permit modifications of this nature would likely require public hearings and opportunities for input and may take as long as 2 years or more to complete. Federal statutory prohibition on HLW disposal at WIPP. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act prohibits disposal of HLW at WIPP. Therefore, to enable EM to dispose of the SBW at WIPP, the SBW would need to be classified as non-HLW, or the act would need to be amended to remove the prohibition. DOE has a process for determining that certain waste resulting from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, such as the SBW and calcine waste, could be managed as either transuranic waste or low-level waste, which are not HLW. Under DOE Order 435.1 and Manual 435.1-1, DOE may determine that waste is incidental to reprocessing and therefore manage the waste as transuranic waste or low-level waste if it meets certain criteria. EM began developing documentation supporting a waste incidental to reprocessing determination for the SBW in 2001. For example, in September 2001, EM requested consultation from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees the nuclear power industry, on a draft waste incidental to reprocessing determination so that the SBW could be managed as transuranic waste and disposed of at WIPP rather than in an HLW repository. DOE’s Authority to Determine That Certain Waste Is Not HLW In 2002, while litigation over the Department of Energy’s (DOE) authority to use DOE Order 435.1 and Manual 435.1-1 was pending, DOE sought enactment of legislation clarifying its authority to manage portions of tank waste that have low levels of radioactivity as low- level waste. In response, Congress enacted section 3116 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 in October 2004. Under section 3116, radioactive waste resulting from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel is not high- level waste (HLW) if the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, determines that it meets specified conditions. These conditions include that the waste does not require disposal in a deep geologic repository and has had highly radioactive radionuclides removed to the maximum extent practical. However, section 3116 only applies to waste stored at DOE sites in Idaho and South Carolina that is not transported from those states. Therefore, DOE cannot use section 3116 to classify the sodium-bearing waste (SBW) as transuranic waste for disposal as DOE’s agreements with Idaho require the SBW to be removed from the state. However, DOE’s authority to use Order 435.1 and Manual 435.1-1 to classify the SBW and other waste from reprocessing as non-HLW was challenged in a federal lawsuit in 2001, resulting in EM suspending its development of the waste incidental to reprocessing determination. Following the dismissal of the lawsuit on procedural grounds, EM restarted the internal process for developing the waste incidental to reprocessing determination for the SBW, according to EM officials and documents. For example, EM identified the waste incidental to reprocessing determination for the SBW as a priority item for executive decision-making in a 2017 EM study on mission operations. Internal discussions about this determination continued between EM and DOE into 2018, but the waste incidental to reprocessing determination was not finalized, according to EM officials. In October 2018, EM published a notice in the Federal Register seeking public comment on its proposed interpretation of the statutory definition of HLW, which EM officials said could help the agency make a decision about the classification of the SBW. EM also published a supplemental notice in June 2019 to modify the interpretation and provide additional information to the public, such as on the role of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and states. Table 1 presents the statutory definition, the proposed interpretation from the October 2018 Federal Register notice, and the modified interpretation from the June 2019 Federal Register notice. EM officials told us that under the new interpretation, waste would be disposed of in accordance with its characteristics (which determines risk) instead of solely based on the source of the waste (which does not determine risk). Stakeholders, including members of the public, state and local governments, tribes, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, expressed a range of perspectives about EM’s proposed interpretation in public comments. For example, some stakeholders submitted comments expressing concern about the Nuclear Regulatory Commission being excluded from the determination of what is HLW under the interpretation. These comments also stated that the interpretation is contrary to federal law and that the interpretation will elicit legal challenges. Other stakeholders expressed support for the interpretation in comments submitted to EM stating, for example, that the proposed interpretation could accelerate the cleanup of tank waste at DOE sites and result in cost savings. According to an EM document, potential benefits of the interpretation, if implemented, include a more risk-based approach to waste classification, which could provide a more cost-effective and timely approach to DOE’s cleanup mission. However, EM officials stated that it was premature to discuss the administrative actions, such as revising orders or regulations that would be required to implement the new interpretation. The June 2019 Federal Register notice states that DOE will consider what actions may be needed and appropriate to update applicable DOE directives, such as Order 435.1 and Manual 435.1-1, in light of this interpretation and address any revisions in future actions. EM officials also told us that they did not have a timeline for implementing the new interpretation. Further, EM officials stated that if the HLW interpretation is implemented, alternative disposal options could also be considered for the SBW, but they declined to specify what those options could be. Limitations on disposal at WIPP. Further, existing limitations in the disposal space at WIPP could affect the disposal of the SBW at the facility. We reported in September 2017 that DOE does not currently have sufficient disposal space at WIPP for the waste identified in its 2016 annual inventory report—a document that tracks waste intended to be disposed of at the facility. Specifically, DOE will need to expand the repository to accommodate this waste as well as other potential waste, such as the SBW, for which DOE has yet to determine if it meets all of WIPP’s waste acceptance criteria. In March 2019, DOE officials stated that WIPP could be expanded within the current Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act boundary for the site to accommodate the current planned waste and additional waste inventories. Specifically, DOE officials said that mining for a new disposal panel and design work for additional disposal panels was under way, and mining of the additional panel was scheduled to commence in 2021. Further, in September 2017 we also reported that additional potential waste beyond what is captured in the inventory could exceed WIPP’s statutory capacity. However, in December 2018, New Mexico’s Environment Department approved a modification to the WIPP permit—which was requested by DOE and its contractor that operates and manages WIPP—that will change the way waste volume is calculated to exclude empty space inside waste packing. According to DOE officials, this means that additional waste can be disposed of at WIPP under the existing statutory limit. Further, DOE officials stated that the revised counting methodology will reduce an overstatement in the volume of record for emplaced waste by about 30 percent. However, in January 2019 three environmental organizations filed lawsuits challenging the modification, which the court consolidated and, in May 2019, stayed pending mediation. EM officials said that if the office is not able to dispose of the SBW at WIPP, its plan is to dispose of the SBW—once it is treated to a solid form in the IWTU—with the calcine waste in an HLW geologic repository. However, there is still no HLW disposal site in the United States. In 2008, DOE submitted a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for an HLW repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas. In 2010, however, DOE terminated its efforts to obtain a license for the Yucca Mountain repository. Under the 1995 settlement agreement with the state of Idaho, DOE is required to treat the SBW so that it is ready for disposal outside of the state by a target date of 2035. An EM official responsible for the disposition of the SBW at INL told us that EM has not developed a strategy, including a timeline, for addressing challenges, including the WIPP permit prohibition, the federal law prohibition, and existing capacity limitations, that could affect EM’s ability to meet this target date. According to standards for internal control, federal agency management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving a defined objective. Until it develops such a strategy, including a timeline, to implement the actions required to achieve its preferred disposal pathway, or an alternative, for the SBW, EM will not have reasonable assurance that it can achieve its preferred plan for disposal or begin identifying an alternative. Moreover, if EM implements its new interpretation of HLW and uses this definition to classify the SBW as non- HLW, there is significant risk for extended litigation, which may delay to EM’s plans to dispose of the SBW at its preferred disposal site. EM faces challenges implementing its selected treatment technology for calcine waste and faces uncertainties with a waste disposal pathway. As a result, the agency is suspending further development of its plan to treat calcine waste for land disposal, according to EM documents and officials. EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials told us that the agency is continuing to make progress toward its milestones for calcine waste disposal by considering alternatives for processing the waste for land disposal and conducting a pilot project to remove it from the oldest storage vessel. However, EM does not have a strategy or timeline for determining its next steps for the ultimate treatment and disposal of calcine waste. Because of challenges with implementing its chosen treatment technology as well as selecting a potential waste disposal pathway, EM is suspending further development of its plan to treat calcine waste for land disposal, according to EM documents and officials. In December 2009 EM identified hot isostatic pressing as its preferred treatment technology for preparing the calcine waste for land disposal outside of Idaho. Hot isostatic pressing is a manufacturing process that applies elevated temperatures and pressurized gas to materials in a containment vessel, resulting in a ceramic waste form. EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project told us that while hot isostatic pressing is a technology used in other industries, such as in industrial manufacturing, it has not been used before to treat HLW. Further, hot isostatic pressing would require a variance or an EPA regulation establishing a new treatment standard prior to land disposal. According to EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials and agency documents, EM selected hot isostatic pressing as the treatment technology because EM’s analyses assumed it would result in significant cost savings for disposal at Yucca Mountain compared to other methods. In February 2011, an independent DOE review team issued a preliminary technology readiness assessment for using hot isostatic pressing for calcine waste treatment as part of DOE’s process for managing capital asset projects. The review team identified several concerns, such as whether components of the technology would be mature enough to meet EM’s planned milestones and challenges with EM’s decision to retrofit and reuse the IWTU for the calcine waste treatment mission. EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project said that the decision to retrofit and reuse the IWTU for the calcine waste after treating the SBW resulted from reluctance within DOE to build another “first-of-a-kind” treatment facility. However, the review team’s report stated that the decision to retrofit the facility may result in logistical and physical maintenance challenges because of space limitations and height requirements. Based on the results of an independent analysis of alternatives for calcine waste disposition, published in April 2016, EM decided to suspend developing the hot isostatic pressing technology, according to EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project. DOE initiated this analysis of alternatives in response to a new requirement from the Secretary of Energy and because hot isostatic pressing is not a mature technology for HLW, according to EM’s summary report for the analysis. The report identified uncertainties and challenges with the use of hot isostatic pressing when compared to other potential treatment options given, including that hot isostatic pressing is significantly different than vitrification and would require the development and acceptance of testing protocols to validate that it produces a robust waste form, hot isostatic pressing had the second greatest estimated cost (more than $2 billion) of the options assessed in the analysis of alternatives, hot isostatic pressing represented the highest operational safety risk of all of the options assessed given its use of high pressures and temperatures, and other treatment options may perform better for managing the waste because of significant advances in technology since the selection of hot isostatic pressing in 2009. The independent team performing this analysis also concluded that uncertainties regarding plans for an HLW geologic repository also affect EM’s ability to move forward with selecting a treatment technology. According to EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project and documents, EM’s selection of hot isostatic pressing was based on assumptions developed based on sending the waste to the Yucca Mountain disposal facility. Specifically, an important factor in the selection of hot isostatic pressing as the treatment technology was its ability to provide the lowest volume of final waste, while producing a robust waste form, which would reduce disposal costs at Yucca Mountain. As previously noted, the licensing for developing the Yucca Mountain facility was terminated in 2010. The team performing the analysis of alternatives concluded that because selecting an appropriate treatment technology greatly depends on the calcine waste’s disposal path and associated waste form performance requirements, EM should defer making a final decision on the treatment technology until the performance objectives of the disposal path are better defined. While further decisions regarding a treatment technology for the calcine waste are suspended, EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project said that they are taking steps to demonstrate to regulators from Idaho’s Department of Environmental Quality that they are making progress to prepare the calcine waste for disposal outside the state. Under DOE’s 1995 settlement agreement with Idaho, treatment of all calcine waste is to be completed by a target date of December 31, 2035. Further, DOE is required to meet interim milestones for the cleanup of the waste under a site treatment plan that DOE developed for the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project told us that they planned to work with the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality to make changes to milestones specific to calcine waste in the site treatment plan, and Idaho Department of Environmental Quality officials stated in December 2018 that preliminary discussions on this topic occurred in September 2018. Further, EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials identified actions that EM is taking at the site to study alternatives to treatment and aspects of the disposal process. EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project stated that with the suspension of developing hot isostatic pressing, they are studying the potential packaging of the calcine waste for disposal without additional treatment, or “direct disposal.” The analysis of alternatives report identified direct disposal as having significant cost savings over other technologies. However, the team performing the analysis of alternatives also found that this method has a high degree of regulatory uncertainty and it is not clear whether it would be accepted by stakeholders, such as state regulators and the public. EPA officials told us that if EM wanted to proceed with plans for the direct disposal of the calcine waste in a geologic repository, EM would need, among other things, to seek a no-migration variance from EPA. A petition for a no-migration variance must demonstrate, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that the hazardous components would not leak or escape once the HLW is buried underground for as long as the waste remains hazardous. EPA officials added that there is a very high bar for such variances; only one such request has been approved since 1984, and it was later rescinded. In February 2019, an EM Idaho Cleanup Project official told us that EM has met with officials from the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality and EPA to receive their preliminary input on this approach. EM Idaho Cleanup Project officials said that they are focusing in the near term on developing and testing a system to retrieve the calcine waste from its storage vessels, called bin sets. According to EM documents, retrieval of the calcine waste from the bin sets is a precursor to treating or packaging the waste for disposal, and there are several challenges to address in developing an effective retrieval system. As a result, EM directed its contractor to conduct a project to retrieve calcine waste from the oldest bin set and move it to a partially empty bin set under EM’s contract for hazardous waste cleanup at INL. The project serves to both test different forms of technologies and also to cease use of the older bin set, which does not have the same structural integrity as the other bin set because of its design, according to EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project and documents. The project is estimated to cost $50 million over 5 years, according to these officials. Fluor Idaho’s plan for the calcine waste retrieval project involves developing a full-scale mock-up of the retrieval process for testing in fiscal years 2019 and 2020, with the commissioning and start-up of the full-scale system and transfer of the waste to occur in fiscal year 2021. In February 2019, an EM official told us that $6 million was obligated to the pilot project in fiscal year 2019 in part because of increased costs for the IWTU reengineering project and cleanup of transuranic waste at INL. Despite these efforts, EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project acknowledged that the agency has no plan to issue a new Record of Decision or amend the 2010 Record of Decision selecting the treatment option for calcine waste. Although EM identified challenges with using hot isostatic pressing for the treatment of the calcine waste in its technical readiness assessment in 2011 and analysis of alternatives in 2016, an EM official told us that the agency does not have a strategy for determining its next steps in treating this waste for land disposal. According to standards for internal control, federal agency management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving a defined objective. Without developing a strategy, including a timeline, to identify and develop a treatment approach for the calcine waste, EM does not have reasonable assurance that it will meet milestones for the completion of treatment of all calcine by a target date of December 31, 2035. EM has been working since 2005 to construct and operate the IWTU to treat the SBW and calcine waste at INL. Despite declaring construction complete in 2012 at a cost of $571 million, EM is still working to repair and reengineer the IWTU following the discovery of facility problems during testing, with expenditures surpassing $416 million. EM has made progress in identifying the engineering problems plaguing the facility and implementing technical changes and expects to complete the second of the four phases of the reengineering project in mid-2019, with its next series of system testing to begin in early 2020. However, EM has experienced significant cost increases and schedule delays in phase two of the IWTU project, and additional engineering and testing remains to be completed before beginning a multiyear effort to treat the SBW. EM’s ability to achieve the project’s estimated cost and schedule in phase two may have been hampered because EM has not fully followed best practices for ensuring that the cost estimate is complete and the schedule estimate is well-constructed. By ensuring that the cost estimate for future phases of the IWTU reengineering project and the SBW treatment operations is comprehensive (e.g., account for all possible costs), EM will have greater assurance that it can successfully plan program resource requirements. Moreover, by developing a well-constructed schedule estimate for the IWTU reengineering project and the SBW treatment operations, EM will have greater assurance that it can successfully achieve its plans to reengineer the IWTU and begin treatment of the SBW without further delays. Further, while EM is using an EVM system to measure the performance of the project and generally followed best practices for EVM systems, the system produces unreliable data. By following best practices for ensuring EVM data reliability for the IWTU reengineering project’s EVM system, EM leadership will have better access to reliable performance data as it manages billions of dollars’ worth of cleanup work and provides information to Congress and other stakeholders on the cleanup work every year. EM faces long-standing challenges to implementing its preferred alternative for disposing of the treated SBW at WIPP. Key among these challenges are provisions in federal law and the WIPP permit that prevent EM from disposing of the SBW at WIPP. EM has taken some steps toward addressing these challenges, such as seeking public comment on its new interpretation of the statutory definition of HLW that according to EM could allow the waste to be disposed of at WIPP or an alternative to an HLW geologic repository. However, EM has no strategy or timeline for making any changes to DOE policies and regulations that may be required to implement its new interpretation or for making decisions regarding disposing of the SBW. Until it develops such a strategy, including a timeline, to implement the actions required to achieve its preferred disposal pathway, or an alternative, for the SBW, EM will not have reasonable assurance that it can achieve its preferred plan for disposal or begin the process of identifying an alternative. Further, if EM implements its new interpretation of HLW and uses this definition to classify the SBW as non-HLW, there is significant risk for extended litigation, which may delay EM’s plans to dispose of the SBW at its preferred disposal site. Moreover, EM faces challenges in completing treatment of the calcine waste by a target date of December 31, 2035, in light of its decision to suspend development of the selected treatment technology, hot isostatic pressing, and the absence of an HLW geologic repository. Even though EM is studying alternatives to using hot isostatic pressing to prepare the calcine waste for disposal, it has not developed a strategy or a timeline for determining its plans for treating this waste for disposal. Without developing such a strategy, including a timeline, for the treatment and disposal of the calcine waste to ensure that EM meets the milestone for completing the treatment of the waste by December 31, 2035, EM does not have reasonable assurance that it can meet its milestones. We are making five recommendations to DOE: The Secretary of Energy should direct the Assistant Secretary of EM to develop cost estimates for the IWTU reengineering project and the SBW treatment operations that meet best practices for being comprehensive (e.g., account for all costs). (Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Energy should direct the Assistant Secretary of EM to develop schedule estimates for the IWTU reengineering project and the SBW treatment operations that meet best practices for being well- constructed. (Recommendation 2) The Secretary of Energy should direct the Assistant Secretary of EM to follow best practices for ensuring the reliability for the IWTU reengineering project’s EVM system. (Recommendation 3) The Secretary of Energy should direct the Assistant Secretary of EM to develop a strategy, including a timeline, for implementing the actions required to achieve its preferred disposal pathway, or an alternative, for the SBW. (Recommendation 4) The Secretary of Energy should direct the Assistant Secretary of EM to develop a strategy, including a timeline, to identify and develop a treatment approach for the disposal of the calcine waste to ensure that EM meets the milestone for completing the treatment of this waste by the target date of December 31, 2035. (Recommendation 5) We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator of the EPA. DOE provided written comments on the draft report, which are presented in appendix IV. EPA did not provide written comments. DOE and EPA both provided technical comments that we incorporated in the report as appropriate. DOE agreed with our recommendations related to the management of the IWTU reengineering project, including developing cost and schedule estimates that meet best practices and ensuring the reliability of the EVM system for the project. Regarding the cost estimate, DOE committed to developing cost estimates that meet best practices and stated that cost estimates for phases three and four of the IWTU reengineering project have been developed and reviewed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. For the schedule estimate, DOE stated that the schedules for phases three and four have been developed and that the inclusion of these phases in the schedule is in accordance with best practices for the well-constructed characteristic. With regard to the EVM system, DOE stated that cost and performance data will be included in the EVM system in accordance with EVM best practices once contract negotiations are completed, which the agency estimated would conclude by December 31, 2019. DOE also agreed with our recommendations to develop a strategy, including a timeline, for the disposal of the SBW and calcine waste. DOE further stated that EM is in the process of developing a site options analysis for INL and other EM sites to identify opportunities to complete cleanup work through more efficient and innovative approaches over the next decade. This analysis is expected to be completed in fiscal year 2020, according to DOE. DOE stated that EM’s HLW interpretation issued in June 2019 could potentially open new disposal pathways for some reprocessing waste, such as SBW and calcine, while noting that decisions about whether and how this interpretation will apply to existing wastes have yet to be made. In its written comments, DOE disagreed with our recommendation to seek clarification from Congress on DOE’s authority to classify the SBW as other than HLW if such clarification is necessary to avoid extended litigation. DOE stated the agency does not require additional clarification from Congress to classify reprocessing waste as other than HLW. We are deleting our recommendation but continue to believe that there is significant risk for extended litigation if EM implements its new interpretation of HLW and uses this definition to classify the SBW as non- HLW. Extended litigation may delay EM’s plans to dispose of the SBW at its preferred disposal site. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and other interested parties.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made significant contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. Our report examines (1) the extent to which the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Environmental Management’s (EM) management of the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU) reengineering project follows selected project management best practices; (2) challenges EM faces in the disposal of the sodium-bearing waste (SBW); and (3) challenges EM faces in the treatment and disposal of the calcine waste. To address these three objectives, we conducted a site visit to DOE’s Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in December 2017. During the site visit, we obtained documentation and interviewed officials from EM, which is responsible for hazardous waste cleanup at INL through its Idaho Cleanup Project. We also interviewed representatives from Fluor Idaho, LLC, which is the private contractor that manages hazardous waste cleanup at INL for EM, including the cleanup of the SBW and calcine waste. In addition, we conducted a site visit to Hazen Research, Inc., a subcontractor to Fluor Idaho, to observe pilot testing facilities for the IWTU reengineering project and discuss the status of the project with an EM official from the Idaho Cleanup Project and representatives from Hazen Research, Inc., and Fluor Idaho. To assess the extent to which EM’s management of the IWTU reengineering project meets selected project management best practices, we first identified areas deemed to be important to project management based on our previous work on DOE projects and leading practices from the Project Management Institute, which are generally recognized as leading practices for project management. Specifically, we reviewed the project management leading practices identified in the Project Management Institute’s A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge—Sixth Edition. From this review, we selected project management practices related to developing cost and schedule estimates and conducting project monitoring through the use of earned value management (EVM) and independent reviews. We then conducted assessments of these best practices, as discussed below. Cost. To determine the extent to which the cost estimate for the IWTU reengineering project is reliable, we conducted an abridged analysis of the IWTU reengineering project’s cost estimate, focusing on its comprehensiveness. Typically, in analyzing a cost estimate against best practices in GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide (cost guide), we examine four characteristics, each defined by multiple criteria: credible. For this review, we assessed the cost estimate for the IWTU reengineering project against the comprehensive characteristic, in part because EM officials told us that they had yet to develop a cost estimate for the program beyond phases one and two at the time of our review. Specifically, we reviewed the cost estimate for the operation of the IWTU and the IWTU reengineering project, which, at the time of our review, was only developed for phases one and two of the project. If a cost estimate is not comprehensive (that is, complete), then it cannot fully meet the well- documented, accurate, or credible best practice characteristics. For instance, if the cost estimate is missing some cost elements, then the documentation will be incomplete, the estimate will be inaccurate, and the result will not be credible because of the potential underestimating of costs and the absence of a full risk and uncertainty analysis. See appendix II for a summary assessment of the IWTU reengineering project’s cost estimate compared to selected best practices. Schedule. To assess EM’s schedule for the IWTU reengineering project, we conducted an abridged analysis of the IWTU reengineering project’s schedule, focusing on comprehensiveness and the degree to which it is well-constructed. Typically, in analyzing a schedule estimate against best practices in GAO’s Schedule Assessment Guide (schedule guide), we examine four characteristics, each defined by multiple criteria: controlled. For this review, we assessed the IWTU reengineering project schedule that EM provided in March 2018 against the well-constructed characteristic, in part because EM officials told us that they had yet to develop a schedule estimate for the totality of the reengineering project because of Fluor Idaho’s phased approach. If a schedule estimate is not well-constructed, it will not be able to properly calculate dates and predict changes in the future. When activities are missing logic links, the schedule will not be able to automatically transmit these delays to future activities that depend on them. When this happens, the schedule will not allow a sufficient understanding of the program as a whole, and users of the schedule will not have confidence in the dates and the critical path. In addition, we evaluated the comprehensive characteristic because it contributed to our analysis of EM’s EVM system, as described below. See appendix II for a summary assessment of the IWTU reengineering project’s schedule estimate compared to selected best practices. EVM. In addition, we analyzed EM’s use of EVM as a way to assess its monitoring of the IWTU reengineering project’s cost and schedule. EVM measures the value of work accomplished in a given period and compares it with the planned value of work scheduled for the period and with the actual cost of the work accomplished. It is an industry standard and is considered a best practice for conducting cost and schedule performance analysis for projects. Our EVM analysis focused on Fluor Idaho’s EVM data for the IWTU reengineering project contained in cost performance reports from March 2017 to February 2018 and the project schedule that EM provided in March 2018. Specifically, we compared this project documentation with EVM best practices as identified in our cost guide. Our research has identified a number of best practices that are the basis of effective EVM and should result in reliable and valid data that can be used for making informed decisions. These best practices have been collapsed into three high-level characteristics of a reliable EVM system, which are establish a comprehensive EVM system, ensure that the data resulting from the EVM system are reliable, and ensure that the program management team is using EVM data for decision-making purposes. See appendix III for our summary assessment of the IWTU reengineering project’s EVM data compared to best practices. EVM data are considered reliable if the overall assessment ratings for each of the three characteristics are substantially or fully met. If any of the characteristics are not met, minimally met, or partially met, then the EVM data cannot be considered reliable. Independent reviews. To assess the extent to which DOE has conducted independent reviews of the IWTU reengineering project, we examined DOE and EM policies to identify requirements for conducting reviews of operations activities. Specifically, we reviewed a 2016 DOE memorandum that established that DOE’s Project Management Risk Committee (PMRC) would provide independent review of selected projects in the operational release phase, the PMRC’s standard operating procedures, and EM’s guidance for projects in the operational release milestone. We examined documentation from the PMRC’s reviews of the IWTU reengineering project, including documentation that EM officials from the Idaho Cleanup Project prepared for these reviews and recommendations that the PMRC made to EM for the project. In addition, we spoke with officials from DOE’s Office of Project Management, which serves as the secretariat of the PMRC; EM’s Office of Acquisition & Project Management; and EM’s Idaho Cleanup Project about independent reviews of projects in the operational release phase. To examine challenges EM faces in the disposal of the SBW, we reviewed federal laws, regulations, and DOE policies on radioactive waste management, including those described in DOE Order 435.1 on radioactive waste management and its implementation manual. In addition, we examined EM’s October 2018 and June 2019 Federal Register notices, which provide DOE’s new interpretation of the statutory definition of high-level radioactive waste (HLW). We also reviewed documentation related to EM’s plans for disposing of the SBW at DOE’s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico, such as Record of Decision documents for proposed actions that require development of environmental impact statements, and the hazardous waste facility permit for WIPP that the New Mexico Environment Department issued. We interviewed DOE officials from the Office of the General Counsel; officials from EM’s Idaho Cleanup Project and Carlsbad Field Office, which is responsible for DOE’s oversight of WIPP; and officials from EM’s Office of Regulatory Compliance, Office of Nuclear Materials, and Office of Waste and Materials Management. We also interviewed officials from Idaho’s Department of Environmental Quality and New Mexico’s Environment Department, as well as representatives from two environmental advocacy groups in Idaho and New Mexico, to obtain their perspectives on the challenges facing EM’s SBW disposal efforts. To examine challenges EM faces in the treatment and disposal of the calcine waste, we reviewed federal laws, regulations, and documents that DOE and EM’s contractors for the Idaho Cleanup Project prepared related to the calcine waste cleanup mission. For example, we reviewed documents assessing treatment and disposal alternatives for calcine waste, including a 2016 analysis of alternatives report that EM prepared and a 2015 contractor-prepared report assessing the feasibility of the direct disposal of calcine waste. We interviewed officials from EM’s Idaho Cleanup Project and Office of Nuclear Materials; EM’s Chief Engineer; and representatives from EM’s contractor, Fluor Idaho, about plans for treating and disposing of the calcine waste and the retrieval pilot project. In addition, we reviewed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (RCRA) regulations, guidance, and documents concerning land disposal requirements. We also interviewed officials from EPA’s Office of Land and Emergency Management and Region 10 about EPA’s responsibilities for implementing RCRA. Lastly, we interviewed officials from the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality about how EM’s calcine waste treatment and disposal efforts address milestones in the Idaho Settlement Agreement. We conducted this performance audit from September 2017 to September 2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Table 2 describes the initial cost and schedule estimates for the four phases of the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit reengineering project compared to actual expenditures and schedule as of February 2019. Table 3 details our assessment of the Office of Environmental Management’s (EM) cost estimate for phases one and two of the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU) reengineering project compared to selected best practices for cost estimating published in GAO’s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide (cost guide). For this review, we assessed the cost estimate for the IWTU reengineering project against the comprehensive characteristic, in part because EM officials told us that they had yet to develop a cost estimate for the program beyond phases one and two, at the time of our review of these documents. We assessed the comprehensive characteristic for the IWTU reengineering cost estimate because if a cost estimate is not comprehensive—that is, complete—then it cannot fully meet the other best practice characteristics. According to our analysis, EM’s cost estimate for the IWTU reengineering project partially met best practices for a comprehensive cost estimate. Table 4 details our assessment of EM’s schedule for the IWTU reengineering project compared to selected best practices for project schedules published in GAO’s Schedule Assessment Guide (schedule guide). For this review, we assessed the schedule against the well- constructed characteristic, in part because EM officials told us that they had yet to develop a schedule for the totality of the reengineering project because of the contractor’s phased approach. We assessed the well- constructed characteristic because, among other reasons, if a schedule is not well-constructed, it will not be able to properly calculate dates and predict changes in the future. In addition, we evaluated the comprehensive characteristic as it is needed to evaluate an earned value management system. According to our assessment, EM’s schedule for the reengineering project partially met best practices related to the well- constructed characteristic and substantially met best practices related to the comprehensive characteristic. Table 5 details our assessment of March 2017 to February 2018 data from the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Office of Environmental Management’s (EM) earned value management (EVM) system for the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU) reengineering project. EVM measures the value of work accomplished in a given period and compares it with the planned value of work scheduled for that period and with the actual cost of work accomplished. By using the metrics derived from these values to understand performance status and to estimate cost and time to complete, EVM can alert program managers to potential problems sooner than expenditures alone can. Our research has identified a number of best practices that are the basis of effective EVM and should result in reliable and valid EVM data that can be used for making informed decisions. Specifically, EM followed (i.e., substantially met) best practices to ensure that its EVM system is (1) comprehensive and (2) used by leadership for decision-making, but did not follow (i.e., partially met) best practices to ensure that the data resulting from the EVM system are reliable. In addition to the contact named above, Casey L. Brown (Assistant Director), Emily Ryan (Analyst in Charge), Juaná Collymore, Jennifer Echard, Richard P. Johnson, Jason Lee, Eli Lewine, Katrina Pekar- Carpenter, Karen Richey, Jeanette Soares, Sheryl Stein, Farrah M. Stone, Paul Sturm, and Sara Sullivan made key contributions to this report.\n","   5  Consistent with the discretion afforded by the APA, Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment websites use required and optional fields on comment forms to collect some identity information from commenters. In addition to the text of the comment, agencies may choose to collect identity information by requiring commenters to fill in other fields, such as name, address, and email address before they are able to submit a comment. Regardless of the fields required by the comment form, the selected agencies all accept anonymous comments in practice. Specifically, in the comment forms on Regulations.gov and agency- specific comment websites, a commenter can submit under a fictitious name, such as “Anonymous Anonymous,” enter a single letter in each required field, or provide a fabricated address. In each of these scenarios, as long as a character or characters are entered into the required fields, the comment will be accepted. Further, because the APA does not require agencies to authenticate submitted identity information, neither Regulations.gov nor the agency-specific comment websites contain mechanisms to check the validity of identity information that commenters submit through comment forms. Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment websites also collect some information about public users’ interaction with their websites through application event logs and proxy server logs, though the APA does not require agencies to collect or verify it as part of the rulemaking process. This information, which can include a public user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and operating system, and the time and date of webpage visits, is collected separately from the comment submission process as part of routine information technology management for system security and performance, and cannot be reliably connected to specific comments. Seven of the 10 selected agencies have documented some internal guidance associated with the identity of commenters during the three phases of the public comment process: intake, analysis, and response to comments. However, the focus and substance of this guidance varies by agency and phase of the comment process. As shown in Table 1, for selected agencies that have guidance associated with the identity of commenters, it most frequently relates to the comment intake or response to comment phases of the public comment process. The guidance for these phases addresses activities such as managing duplicate comments (those with identical or near-identical comment text but varied identity information) or referring to commenters in a final rule. Agencies are not required by the APA to develop internal guidance associated with the public comment process generally, or identity information specifically. Within the discretion afforded by the APA, the 10 selected agencies’ treatment of identity information varies during the three phases of the public comment process. Selected agencies differ in how they treat identity information during the comment intake phase, particularly in terms of how they post duplicate comments, which can lead to identity information being inconsistently presented to public users of comment systems. Generally, officials told us that their agencies either (1) maintain all comments within the comment system, or (2) maintain some duplicate comment records outside of the comment system, for instance, in email file archives. When an agency chooses to post a sample of duplicate comments, the identity information and unique comment contents for all duplicate comments may not be present on the public website. For example, for all duplicate comments received, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) posts a single example for each set of duplicate comments and indicates the total number of comments received. As a result, the identity information and any unique comment content beyond the first example are not present on the public website. (See fig. 1.) Selected agencies’ treatment of identity information during the comment analysis phase also varies. Specifically, program offices with the responsibility for analyzing comments place varied importance on identity information during the analysis phase. Finally, all agencies draft a response to comments with their final rule, but the extent to which the agencies identify commenters or commenter types in their response also varies across the selected agencies. Our analysis of Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment websites shows that the varied comment posting practices of the 10 selected agencies are not always documented or clearly communicated to public users of the websites. The E-Government Act of 2002 requires that all public comments and other materials associated with a given rulemaking should be made “publicly available online to the extent practicable.” In addition to the requirements of the E-Government Act, key practices for transparently reporting open government data state that federal government websites—like those used to facilitate the public comment process—should fully describe the data that are made available to the public, including by disclosing data sources and limitations. We found that the selected agencies we reviewed do not effectively communicate the limitations and inconsistencies in how they post identity information associated with public comments. As a result, public users of the comment websites lack information related to data availability and limitations that could affect their ability to use and make informed decisions about the comment data and effectively participate in the rulemaking process themselves. Public users of Regulations.gov seeking to submit a comment are provided with a blanket disclosure statement related to how their identity information may be disclosed, and are generally directed to individual agency websites for additional detail about submitting comments. While additional information is provided in the Privacy Notice, User Notice, and Privacy Impact Assessment for Regulations.gov, public users are not provided any further detail on Regulations.gov regarding what information, including identity information, they should expect to find in the comment data. Additionally, there is not enough information to help public users determine whether all of the individual comments and associated identity information are posted. Available resources on Regulations.gov direct public users to participating agencies’ websites for additional information about agency-specific review and posting policies. Seven of the eight participating agencies’ websites direct public users back to Regulations.gov and the Federal Register, either on webpages that are about the public comment process in general, or on pages containing information about specific NPRMs. Three of these participating agencies – the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – do provide public users with information beyond directing them back to Regulations.gov or the Federal Register, but only FDA provides users with details about posting practices that are not also made available on Regulations.gov. The eighth participating agency – the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) – does not direct public users back to Regulations.gov, and instead recreates all rulemaking materials for each NPRM on its own website, including individual links to each submitted comment. However, these links go directly to comment files, and do not link to Regulations.gov. While EBSA follows departmental guidance associated with posting duplicate comments, which allows some discretion in posting practices, the agency does not have a policy for how comments are posted to Regulations.gov or its own website. Further, in the examples we reviewed, the content of the NPRM-specific pages on EBSA’s website does not always match what is posted to Regulations.gov. Because participating agencies are not required to adhere to standardized posting practices, Regulations.gov directs public users to participating agency websites for additional information about posting practices and potential data limitations. However, these websites do not describe the limitations associated with the identity information contained in publicly posted comments. As allowed for under the APA, all of the participating agencies in our review vary in the way in which they post identity information associated with comments—particularly duplicate comments. However, the lack of accompanying disclosures may potentially lead users to assume, for example, that only one entity has weighed in on an issue when, actually, that comment represents 500 comments. Without better information about the posting process, the inconsistency in the way in which duplicate comments are presented to public users of Regulations.gov limits public users’ ability to explore and use the data and could lead users to draw inaccurate conclusions about the public comments that were submitted and how agencies considered them during the rulemaking process. Both nonparticipating agencies use comment systems other than Regulations.gov and follow standardized posting processes associated with public comments submitted to their respective comment systems, but SEC has not clearly communicated these practices to the public. Although it appears to users of the SEC website that the agency follows a consistent process for posting duplicate comments, at the time of our June 2019 report, this practice had not been documented or communicated to public users of its website. In contrast, FCC identifies its policies for posting comments and their associated identity information in a number of places on the FCC.gov website, and on its Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) web page within the general website. Regarding comments submitted to rulemaking proceedings through ECFS, public users are informed that all information submitted with comments, including identity information, will be made public. Our review of ECFS comment data did not identify discrepancies with this practice. Although the public comment process allows interested parties to state their views about prospective rules, the lack of communication with the public about the way in which agencies treat identity information during the posting process, particularly for duplicate comments, may inhibit users’ meaningful participation in the rulemaking process. While the APA does not include requirements for commenters to provide identity information, or for agency officials to include commenters identity as part of their consideration of comments, key practices for transparently reporting open government data state that federal government websites— like those used to facilitate the public comment process—should fully describe the data that are made available to the public, including by disclosing data sources and limitations. As shown in Table 2, we recommended in our June 2019 report that five of the selected agencies establish a policy for posting comments, and that eight selected agencies take action to more clearly communicate their policies for posting comments, particularly with regard to identity information and duplicate comments. These agencies generally agreed with our recommendations and identified actions they planned to take in response, such as developing policies for posting duplicate comments and communicating those in various ways to public users. Since issuing our June 2019 report, all of the agencies to which we made recommendations have provided us with additional updates. Specifically, SEC completed actions that are responsive to the recommendation we made to it. In this regard, in September 2019, SEC issued a memorandum that reflects SEC’s internal policies for posting duplicate comments and associated identity information. SEC has also communicated these policies to public users on the SEC.gov website by adding a disclaimer on the main comment posting page that describes how the agency posts comments. These measures will help public users better determine whether and how they can use the data associated with public comments. The other seven agencies have provided updates, but have not yet implemented the recommendations. In December 2019 and January 2020, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), EPA, and FWS notified us that they are in the process of developing or updating policies for posting public comments as well as statements for their websites to communicate these policies to the public. Similarly, in January 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) would update its comment posting policy and communicate it on the CMS website. However, the excerpt of the policy language provided does not include information about how the agency posts duplicate comments. Further, CMS did not provide us with the finalized policy, and our review of the website does not indicate any changes have been made. HHS officials stated they would provide additional follow up actions by July 2020. In September 2019, EBSA also stated that it will develop a written policy regarding posting of comments, including duplicate comments, which will be available on its website. However, the agency did not provide evidence that a formal evaluation of its current practice of replicating rulemaking dockets had been conducted, and did not identify plans to do so. The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) indicated that it will add text to each webpage for any rulemaking that invites public comments that states any personal information included in the comments (including duplicate) will be posted to Regulations.gov without change. However, the preliminary text provided by officials in August 2019 does not explain WHD’s policy of posting duplicate comments as a group under a single document ID, and therefore does not clearly communicate the agency’s posting practices to the public. Chairman Green, Ranking Member Barr, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared remarks. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have at this time.

For individuals to receive care from a Medicare-approved hospice program, they must elect the hospice benefit by signing a statement indicating they are waiving their rights to Medicare payment for services related to curative treatment of their terminal illness. When enrolling in Medicare hospice care, beneficiaries can receive several different types of services in various settings. Most hospice beneficiaries receive hospice care in their own home, but they can also receive care in other settings, such as a nursing home, assisted living facility, hospice facility, or hospital. The Medicare hospice benefit covers a variety of services and supplies for the palliation and management of the terminal illness, including physician and nursing services, medical equipment and supplies including drugs for pain and symptom management, hospice aide and homemaker services, physical and occupational therapy, and spiritual and grief and loss counseling. A hospice interdisciplinary team (in collaboration with the beneficiary’s primary care provider, if any) works with the beneficiary, family, and caregiver(s) to develop a plan of care that addresses the physical, psychosocial, spiritual, and emotional needs of the beneficiary, family members, and caregiver(s). The hospice provider must make all services under the Medicare hospice benefit available to beneficiaries as needed, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Although hospice care is designed for beneficiaries with a life expectancy of 6 months or less, beneficiaries can receive hospice care beyond 6 months if they continue to meet hospice eligibility requirements. In addition, beneficiaries can disenroll from the hospice benefit at any time and re-enroll in hospice care at a later time. CMS pays hospices based on the level of hospice care provided to beneficiaries on a given day. There are four levels of hospice care, which are paid at either a daily rate or an hourly rate depending on the location and intensity of services provided. (See table 1.) Each care level has a payment rate that is adjusted for geographic differences in wages, and CMS updates these payment rates annually. The most common level of care is called routine home care (accounting for 98 percent of all Medicare hospice care in 2017), and hospices receive the routine home care payment daily rate regardless of whether beneficiaries receive any services on a given day. In addition, CMS imposes two payment limitations (referred to as caps) on Medicare payment for hospice services—one that limits a hospice’s number of inpatient days and one that limits a hospice’s total Medicare payments in a given year. In response to requirements in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, CMS established the Hospice Quality Reporting Program, which currently includes two sets of data to assess the quality of hospice providers’ care; CMS publishes these data on its Hospice Compare website. Medicare hospice providers are required to submit these data to CMS for all patients regardless of payer source (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance). The two data sets are the following: Provider-reported quality measure data. This set of data (which CMS refers to as the Hospice Item Set) is used to calculate a hospice provider’s performance on quality measures, which include seven measures that reflect the percentage of all hospice patients’ stays where the provider completed various key care processes, such as screening patients for pain and shortness of breath. CMS also recently implemented an eighth measure, called the composite measure, which calculates the percentage of patients’ hospice stays in which the hospice provider completed all seven care process quality measures. Caregivers’ experience survey data. This set of data (referred to as the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS®) Hospice Survey) is a national survey that captures, from the caregiver’s (family member or friend) perspective, the patient’s experience with hospice care. The survey includes questions that are used to calculate eight quality measures based on survey responses. For example, one measure scores how well the hospice communicated with the patient’s family. CMS oversees the quality of Medicare hospice care primarily through inspections—referred to as surveys—which are conducted by state survey agencies contracted by CMS or CMS-approved national private accrediting organizations. These surveys are used to determine whether the hospice is in compliance with federal health and safety requirements detailed in Medicare’s hospice conditions of participation. A hospice must be in compliance with these conditions to participate in the Medicare program. Medicare’s hospice conditions of participation include requirements related to patient care and organizational environment (e.g., the hospice must organize, manage, and administer its resources to provide necessary care). Each condition of participation is composed of standards associated with the condition, and a standard may have associated sub-components. For example, the “patient’s rights” condition includes standards such as “notice of rights and responsibilities” and “rights of the patient.” The “rights of the patient” standard includes sub- components, such as the patient has the right to receive effective pain management and symptom control. There are three main types of survey inspections—an initial certification survey when a provider first seeks to participate in Medicare; a re- certification survey to ensure ongoing compliance; and surveys to investigate complaints or incidents related to federal requirements. If a hospice is found to be out of compliance with hospice health and safety requirements during a survey, CMS cites the provider for non- compliance—referred to as a deficiency. These deficiencies are categorized at one of two levels: Condition-level deficiencies. These deficiencies are the most serious. A condition-level deficiency is one in which the provider violates one or more standards and the deficiencies are of such character as to substantially limit the provider’s capacity to furnish adequate care or which adversely affect the health and safety of patients. When a hospice provider is cited for a condition-level deficiency, CMS places the provider on a 90-day termination track (or 23 days if the situation is determined to pose “immediate jeopardy” to beneficiaries) within which the provider must correct the issue(s) and the correction must be confirmed via a follow-up survey visit. If this does not happen within 90 days of the survey date, CMS terminates the hospice’s Medicare provider agreement; termination is an enforcement remedy CMS uses to ensure compliance. Standard-level deficiencies. These deficiencies are less serious. A hospice provider that has a standard-level deficiency can be certified or re-certified only if the provider has submitted an acceptable plan of correction for achieving compliance within a reasonable period of time. According to CMS officials, standard-level deficiencies must also have follow-up to ensure correction, although the type of follow-up depends on the nature of the deficiency. If a standard-level deficiency is very minor and does not place any beneficiaries at risk, the follow-up may be handled through email or telephone instead of a follow-up visit. According to CMS officials, if a provider fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan of correction within a reasonable period of time acceptable to CMS, the provider is placed on the 90-day termination track noted above. For-profit and non-profit hospices served roughly the same percentage of the approximately 1.5 million Medicare hospice beneficiaries in 2017, even though for-profit hospices make up about two-thirds of all hospice providers. According to our analysis of CMS data, for-profit providers treated about 50 percent of those beneficiaries and non-profit providers treated about 48 percent in 2017. This distribution has been about the same in each year from 2014 through 2017. For example, for these years, the percentages of beneficiaries treated by for-profit providers ranged from 48.7 percent to 50.2 percent (see additional details in app. I, table 7). When comparing the beneficiary populations treated by for-profit and non- profit hospice providers, we found that they generally had similar demographic characteristics. We identified two primary exceptions to this general finding: (1) non-profit hospices had slightly higher percentages of white beneficiaries, and (2) for-profit hospices had a greater proportion of patients enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid. See table 2 (for more detailed data, see app. I, table 8). While beneficiary demographic characteristics were generally similar, we found differences in beneficiary diagnoses between for-profit and non- profit hospices. Specifically, for-profit hospices had, on average, a greater percentage of patients with non-cancer diagnoses—77 percent of for-profit hospice beneficiaries compared to 69 percent of non-profit hospice beneficiaries in 2017. Our analysis found that for-profit providers received a higher proportion of Medicare hospice payments than did non-profit providers. For 2017, about $10.4 billion (58 percent) of the $17.9 billion dollars in Medicare payments were made to for-profit providers and $7.2 billion (40 percent) of payments were to non-profit providers. Our analysis found this same pattern in each year from 2014 through 2017. One reason for-profit hospices received a higher portion of Medicare hospice payments for the period we reviewed is because (as previously noted) they had, on average, a greater percentage of beneficiaries with non-cancer diagnoses, and we found non-cancer beneficiaries, on average, had longer lengths of stay. (See table 3.) Since hospices are typically paid a set amount per day of a hospice stay, longer stays generally result in higher payments. Beneficiaries with non-cancer diagnoses can often have longer lengths of stay compared to other beneficiaries because the progression of these diseases (such as dementia) can be harder to predict; this may result in beneficiaries being enrolled in hospice earlier than appropriate (meaning that their projected life expectancy may actually be longer than 6 months). For instance, one study noted that dementia beneficiaries’ decline may include periods of stabilization where their health stays the same or even improves, which differs from a constant and predictable decline in most beneficiaries with terminal cancer. There are likely other factors beyond a greater percentage of beneficiaries with non-cancer diagnoses that contributed to for-profit providers’ higher portion of Medicare hospice payments. We found that for-profit providers had, on average, longer lengths of stay for both cancer and non-cancer beneficiaries compared to non-profit providers. (See table 3.) For example, non-cancer beneficiaries at for-profit providers had an average length of stay of 108 days, while non-cancer beneficiaries at non- profit providers had an average length of stay of 67 days. This suggests other factors besides beneficiary diagnosis contributed to longer average length of stay for for-profit providers. (For more detailed beneficiary diagnosis data from 2014 to 2017, see app. I, table 9.) For-profit and non-profit hospice providers had similar scores on CMS’s current quality measures (provider-reported measures and caregivers’ experience measures assessed through a survey of the beneficiaries’ caregiver). CMS uses these measures to assess the quality of care provided by hospices. In addition to CMS’s current quality measures, researchers we interviewed noted that there are other care indicators that can also be used to assess the quality of care provided by hospices. According to CMS documents, CMS is working to account for other care indicators by developing additional quality measures. We assessed hospice providers’ performance on these indicators and found that performance varied between for-profit and non-profit hospices. Our review of CMS data found that for 2017, both for-profit and non-profit hospices, on average, had similar scores on the seven quality measures that are provider-reported and that CMS currently uses to assess the quality of hospice care. (See table 4.) For six of the seven measures, for-profit and non-profit hospices had average scores of 94.7 percent or better. We also found that for-profits and non-profits had similar scores (83.6 percent and 87.0 percent, respectively) on a new composite measure that CMS implemented in 2017. This composite measure was designed to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the hospice’s care by determining whether the hospice provider completed all of the applicable parts of hospice care that are measured by the seven quality measures. When looking at the subset of providers with the lowest scores on the composite quality measure, we found that for-profit hospices were more often in this subset, even when accounting for differences in the number of for-profit and non-profit providers: For the composite measure, there were 329 providers (261 for-profits and 68 non-profits) in the 10th percentile of scores or lower, meaning that the providers had a composite measure score of 64.3 percent or lower. Among these providers, we found that for-profits were more likely to be within this grouping, with about 12 percent of all for-profit providers having scores in the 10th percentile or lower compared to 6 percent of all non-profit providers. We also assessed the subset of these 329 providers that had composite measure scores below 50 percent, meaning that they only completed all of CMS’s seven quality measures for half or fewer of the beneficiaries they treated. We found that 130 providers (112 for-profits and 18 non-profits) had scores below 50 percent on this measure. These providers treated over 24,000 beneficiaries. In addition to the provider-reported quality measures, CMS also uses the caregivers’ experience survey to assess quality of care. We analyzed CMS data on caregivers’ experience surveys for 2016 to 2017 and found that caregivers’ reported experience with hospice care was generally similar for both for-profits and non-profits. The survey assesses care in a number of areas, such as communication, training, and help with pain and symptoms. See table 5 (for more detailed data, see app. I, table 10). Although for-profit and non-profit providers’ average scores on the caregivers’ experience survey were generally similar, we found that for- profit providers were more often among those providers with the lowest scores on certain caregivers’ experience measures than were non-profit providers. For example, on the rating measure that asks caregivers to give an overall rating of the hospice, 290 providers (248 for-profit providers and 42 non-profits) had scores at the 10th percentile or lower, meaning that their score was 72 percent or lower. For this measure, lower scores mean that fewer caregivers provided a rating of 9 or 10 on a 10- point scale, with 10 being the highest possible rating. We found that 15 percent of for-profit providers were among providers with scores in the 10th percentile or lower compared to 4 percent of non-profit providers. We used Medicare claims data to calculate certain measures researchers told us could be indicators of quality of care in hospice settings. (As noted previously, CMS is working to account for other care indicators by developing additional quality measures.) These indicators fall into two categories: (1) the number of beneficiaries discharged prior to death (often referred to as the live discharge rate) and (2) provider visits to provide medical and emotional support to the beneficiary and caregivers near the end of a beneficiary’s life. Researchers told us that such measures can fill gaps in assessing the quality of care provided by hospices, and show greater variability across hospices than CMS’s current quality measures; as previously noted, our data analysis found that providers’ quality measure scores were generally very high. According to researchers we interviewed and studies we reviewed, some discharges from hospice care prior to death should be expected because, for example, patients change their mind about receiving hospice care or their condition improves and they are no longer eligible for hospice care. However, a high live discharge rate could in some cases be an indicator of poor quality of care provided or of provider misuse of the benefit, in that they may be enrolling beneficiaries who are not eligible for hospice. See text box. Live Discharges In some cases, a beneficiary may be discharged alive from hospice care prior to their death. This could be for reasons unrelated to the quality of care provided. For example, beneficiaries may reconsider their decision to start palliative treatment, and therefore leave hospice care to re-start curative treatments. In other instances, a live discharge may indicate quality of care issues. For example, a beneficiary may be unhappy with the quality of care she is receiving from her hospice provider and therefore she leaves that hospice provider to seek treatment from a different hospice provider. Given the various reasons for live discharges, we expect that hospices will have some live discharges, but interpret a high rate of live discharges as potentially suggestive of quality of care issues. We found that for-profits had higher rates of live discharges than non- profits, with 22.1 percent of beneficiaries served by for-profits being discharged alive compared to 12.0 percent of beneficiaries served by non-profits in 2017. This disparity remained true after accounting for whether beneficiaries had a cancer or non-cancer diagnosis. (See table 6; for more detailed data from 2014 to 2017, see app. I, table 11.) We found that 472 hospice providers (462 for-profit and 10 non-profit providers) had live discharge rates of 50 percent or more in 2017, meaning that half or more of their beneficiaries were discharged from hospice care prior to death. These providers provided care to about 6 percent of all beneficiaries discharged alive in 2017. According to researchers we interviewed and one of the studies we reviewed, provider visits near the end of a hospice beneficiary’s life are critical to providing quality care, including for emotional support and for training the beneficiary’s family members or other caregivers on the signs and process of dying. Assessing the number of visits near the end of life may provide insight into the quality of a hospice provider’s care; fewer visits in that time period could indicate poor quality of hospice care. CMS is currently developing a quality measure that assesses the frequency of provider visits at the beneficiary’s end of life. When analyzing CMS claims data, we found that for-profit and non-profit hospices, on average, provided a similar number of provider visits (such as nurse, doctor, social worker, or hospice aide visits) within the last 7 days of a beneficiary’s life. Specifically, in 2017, for-profits and non-profits both averaged about 6 provider visits within the last 7 days of life. We also looked at the average percentage of hospice beneficiaries who received different types of provider visits either within the last 3 days of life or last 7 days of life (consistent with CMS’s new quality measure) and found performance varied among for-profit and non-profit providers: 77 percent of for-profit beneficiaries and 85 percent of non-profit beneficiaries received at least one visit from registered nurses, physicians, or nurse practitioners in the last 3 days of life. 68 percent of for-profit beneficiaries and 57 percent of non-profit beneficiaries received at least two visits from medical social workers, chaplains or spiritual counselors, licensed practical nurses, or hospice aides in the last 7 days of life. We also found more for-profits than non-profits among a subset of hospices that did not provide any visits during the last 3 or 7 days of life in 2017. Specifically, our analysis shows that 83 hospice providers (80 for- profits and 3 non-profits) did not provide any visits in 2017 from registered nurses, physicians, or nurse practitioners in the beneficiaries’ last 3 days of life. This means that all of the 800 hospice beneficiaries treated by these providers did not receive these types of provider visits at the end of life. In addition, we found that 58 providers (55 for-profits and 3 non- profits) did not provide any visits from medical social workers, chaplains or spiritual counselors, licensed practical nurses, or hospice aides in the last 7 days of life in 2017; all of the 613 beneficiaries treated by these providers did not receive these specific provider visits at the end of life. In our review of CMS’s oversight of hospice providers, we found CMS does not instruct surveyors to review, prior to surveying hospice providers, providers’ performance on CMS quality measures (those based on provider-reported quality data or caregivers’ experience surveys) or other indicators of quality that could identify potential areas of concern. CMS issues guidance that surveyors use when conducting surveys to assess a hospice provider’s compliance with federal health and safety requirements. According to this guidance, surveyors are to prepare for hospice surveys by reviewing documents of record including licensure records, previous survey findings and complaints, media reports, and other publicly available information about the provider. A representative for an association representing state surveyors confirmed that this is the type of information surveyors typically review prior to a hospice provider survey. However, according to CMS officials and the surveyor association, CMS does not instruct surveyors to review other information such as providers’ performance on CMS quality measures or other indicators of quality that surveyors could use to identify potential areas of concern that they could focus on more closely during a survey. For example, it might be helpful for surveyors to know if a hospice provided no visits during beneficiaries’ last days of life. According to CMS officials, CMS does not use such information to target hospices for additional survey review. Several studies we reviewed and researchers we interviewed noted CMS could strengthen its survey process by incorporating additional information into the survey process, such as information on how hospice providers perform on CMS quality measures or other potential indicators of quality. For example, one study suggested that hospices with poor reported beneficiary experiences based on caregivers’ experience survey data could be identified for more frequent surveys and that such information could be used to identify care processes for closer review during surveys. Another study we reviewed concluded that claims- based measures could help guide surveyors to more closely review key processes of care to ensure Medicare beneficiaries receive high quality hospice care. In addition, a researcher we interviewed suggested when claims data show no visits during the last 2 days of life, the survey team could interview the deceased patients’ families to see if there was any harm done by the lack of visits at the end of life. And, in July 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General (HHS OIG) reiterated recommendations from prior HHS OIG work that CMS analyze claims and deficiency data to identify specific patterns identified by the HHS OIG that could indicate potential issues— such as hospices that infrequently provide physician services—and that CMS instruct surveyors to pay special attention to these areas during surveys. In contrast to hospice surveys, home health agency surveyors utilize information in addition to survey findings and complaints to identify potential areas of concern. According to CMS officials and the surveyor association we interviewed, home health surveyors review certain CMS quality measures to focus the survey on specific areas of concern or to identify beneficiaries who experienced potential care issues for a more detailed survey review. According to CMS officials, the agency is considering making changes to the survey process but has not yet made any decisions. CMS officials told us they last updated the survey process in 2010, and since then, they have implemented quality measures for hospice providers (provider- reported measures in 2014 and caregivers’ experience survey measures in 2015). They also said that CMS is “currently monitoring the implementation of these programs and considering the potential benefit of incorporating review of the data into the survey process.” According to federal standards of internal control, agencies must identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving objectives. By not utilizing additional information in the survey process that would allow it to identify providers and areas where risk of noncompliance is greatest, CMS is missing an opportunity to strengthen its ability to identify and respond to such risks and ensure the quality of care that hospice beneficiaries receive. CMS is limited to one hospice enforcement remedy—termination of the Medicare provider agreement. By law, to qualify for payment under the Medicare program, hospice providers must meet the program’s conditions of participation. If the agency finds a provider is not complying with the program’s conditions of participation, CMS may terminate the provider’s participation in the program. In the Medicare program, termination of a provider is the most significant action CMS can take to address provider non-compliance. As a result, CMS generally only terminates a hospice provider on the basis of a deficiency when the provider fails to correct a condition-level deficiency (the most severe) within the required time frame. Our review of CMS hospice survey data found termination happens rarely. Specifically, 19 hospices were involuntarily terminated from 2014 through 2017. This is less than half of 1 percent of the total number of hospices operating during this time period. In contrast to hospice care, where CMS’s enforcement authority is limited to termination, Congress has given the agency authority to impose additional enforcement remedies for other provider types. Additional statutory and regulatory penalties for home health agencies and nursing homes include civil money penalties, denial of payment for all new Medicare and Medicaid admissions, and imposition of training requirements for situations where it is determined that education will likely lead to provider compliance (referred to as directed in-service training). Such remedies, if available, could enable the agency to more effectively address a broader range of hospice risks. For example, additional remedies could be used in situations that warrant a remedy other than termination or that could further incentivize providers to comply with health and safety requirements or improve their quality of care. According to federal standards of internal control, agencies must identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving objectives. Because CMS lacks the authority to establish such additional remedies, the agency’s ability to respond to risks and ensure quality of care for beneficiaries is limited. The HHS OIG and one researcher we interviewed have recommended CMS seek statutory authority to establish additional enforcement remedies for hospices, explaining that less severe remedies could help address performance problems that may not merit termination and incentivize agencies to improve quality of care. CMS agreed with this recommendation in March 2016 and stated it would consider submitting a request that would seek legislative authority to establish additional enforcement remedies through the President’s annual budget proposal to Congress. In a July 2018 HHS OIG report, the HHS OIG again recommended CMS seek this authority. CMS neither agreed nor disagreed with this recommendation and stated again that it would consider this recommendation when developing the agency’s proposals for the President’s annual budget. However, a request for such legislative authority was not included in the President’s fiscal year 2017, 2018, or 2019 budget proposals. The HHS OIG reiterated this recommendation in two July 2019 reports. Since 2000, the number of Medicare hospice beneficiaries has almost tripled to nearly 1.5 million in fiscal year 2017. In addition, the number of hospice providers has doubled. Given this growth, it is imperative that CMS’s oversight of the quality of Medicare hospice care keeps pace with changes so that the agency can ensure the health and safety of these terminally ill beneficiaries. While recent steps have been taken to strengthen CMS’s hospice quality oversight, including the requirement that hospices be re-certified every 3 years and CMS’s ongoing development of new quality measures, we identified additional opportunities to strengthen CMS’s oversight. Specifically, our review found that CMS could strengthen oversight by using additional information—based on currently available data—to identify potential quality issues that could focus and enhance the survey process. We also found that CMS’s lack of authority to establish additional enforcement remedies before termination, which CMS rarely uses, limits its ability to ensure hospice providers’ compliance with health and safety requirements and quality of care for beneficiaries. Congress should consider giving CMS authority to establish additional enforcement remedies for hospices that do not meet federal health and safety requirements. (Matter for Consideration 1) The Administrator of CMS should incorporate the use of additional information, such as quality measures or other information that could identify potential quality of care issues, into its survey process for overseeing hospice providers. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment. HHS provided written comments, which are reprinted in appendix II. HHS concurred with our recommendation. HHS stated that it recognizes that meaningful quality measures can also serve as key indicators of provider quality and it will look into ways to incorporate the use of these data into the hospice survey process. In its comment letter, HHS also noted the importance of monitoring patient safety and quality of care to HHS’s hospice oversight efforts and the agency provided an overview of the key efforts it has in place to perform such monitoring. For example, in addition to survey and quality measure requirements, HHS requires hospices to implement a data-driven quality assessment and performance improvement program, intended to have hospices take a proactive approach in improving their performance using objective data. HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate. As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the CMS administrator, and other interested parties.

These data were not available for all hospice providers; our analysis of CMS caregivers’ experience survey quality measure data was for the 2,832 hospice providers that had data for the caregivers’ survey. In general, the top-box scores represent the percentage of caregivers that selected the response of “always” for the particular measure. For the rating measure, the top-box score represents caregivers that rated the hospice provider as a 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale with 10 being the highest rating. For the recommendation measure, the top-box score represents caregivers that responded that they “would definitely recommend the hospice provider.” In general, the middle-box scores represent the percentage of caregivers that selected the response of “usually” for the particular measure. For the rating measure, the middle-box score represents caregivers that rated the hospice provider as a 7 or 8 on a 10-point scale with 10 being the highest rating. For the recommendation measure, the middle-box score represents caregivers that responded that they “would probably recommend the hospice provider.” In addition to the contact named above, Gregory Giusto, Assistant Director; Christie Enders, Analyst-in-Charge; Todd Anderson, Leia Dickerson, Rob Dougherty, Krister Friday, Barbara Hansen, Jennifer Whitworth, and Chris Wickham made key contributions to this report.\n","   7  Federal agencies are dependent on computerized (cyber) information systems and electronic data to carry out operations and to process, maintain, and report essential information. Cybersecurity—the security of these systems and data—is vital to public confidence. Ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation, including protecting privacy and sensitive data, and IRS’s efforts to address tax refund fraud due to identity theft are issues included in our High Risk List. IRS relies on information system security controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the sensitive financial and taxpayer information that resides on its systems. Federal law and guidance specify requirements for protecting federal information and systems. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) is intended to provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information system security controls over information resources that support federal operations and assets. To accomplish this, FISMA requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to provide security for the information and systems that support the operations and assets of the agency, using a risk-based approach. However, taxpayer information held by third-party providers is generally outside of these requirements, according to IRS officials. Fraudsters may target third parties, such as paid preparers and tax software providers, to steal taxpayer data—defined for our purposes as personally identifiable information and other personal, financial, or federal tax data—which can then be used to commit identity theft refund fraud or other types of financial crimes. Viewed broadly, identity theft tax refund fraud consists of two crimes: (1) stealing or compromising taxpayer data and (2) using stolen (or otherwise compromised) taxpayer data to file a fraudulent tax return and collect a fraudulent refund. Figure 1 presents an example of how this crime can work. In this example, a taxpayer may alert IRS of identity theft refund fraud. Alternatively, IRS can detect identity theft refund fraud through its automated filters that search for specific characteristics, as well as through other reviews of taxpayer returns. Third-party providers retain a large amount of electronic tax information, which makes them targets of various types of data theft incidents. Five common types of security incidents are shown in table 1. The number of electronically filed (e-filed) tax returns, and therefore the amount of electronically available data that are vulnerable to security incidents, has been increasing over the past several decades from 4.2 million in 1990 to 135.5 million in 2018. In 2018, approximately 90 percent of the 150.5 million filed individual income tax returns were filed with IRS electronically (see figure 2). Paid preparers prepared more than half of the e-filed returns in 2018. Multiple IRS offices have discrete responsibilities in overseeing how third- party providers secure taxpayer information, as depicted in figure 3. Oversight responsibilities are as follows: Stakeholder Liaison works with the paid preparer community to educate preparers about information security risks and guide them through the process of resolving security issues when security incidents are reported. This office is also the intake point for security incident information for paid preparers. Cybersecurity works to protect taxpayer information and IRS’s electronic systems, services, and data from internal and external cybersecurity threats—such as damage to computers, electronic communications systems, or information contained in those systems—by implementing security practices. Criminal Investigation (CI) reviews security incident reports to determine whether criminal action has occurred and investigates any potential criminal violations of applicable laws. It also investigates large-scale tax schemes and fraud. The Return Preparer Office is responsible for matters relating to the registration and the program compliance of tax return preparers who prepare returns for compensation. The office also engages in outreach and education programs and administers IRS’s Annual Filing Season program, a voluntary program to encourage noncredentialed preparers to participate in continuing education courses. Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE) Examination revenue agents visit e-file providers to ensure they are complying with the Authorized e-file Provider program’s requirements. Electronic Products and Services Support (EPSS) administers the Authorized e-file Provider program. It is also responsible for updating IRS Publications 1345 and 3112, which outline the requirements of the program. EPSS officials reported that they must coordinate with other business units to update individual references in the publications. EPSS is the intake point for security incident information for online providers and e-Services users, according to officials. Return Integrity and Compliance Services (RICS) monitors taxpayer accounts for potential fraud to protect revenue. RICS also manages the security incident data reports that are submitted by tax software providers. RICS is the intake point for security incident information for Security Summit and Identity Theft Tax Refund Fraud - Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) members, as described below, and actively monitors ISAC alerts from the online platform for new information that may not have been reported elsewhere. While the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) does not have oversight responsibilities over the security of tax information at third parties, it administers the regulations that govern the practice of tax professionals who interact with IRS on behalf of taxpayers, including attorneys, certified public accountants, and enrolled agents, among others. Treasury Department Circular 230, which incorporates the regulations, directed the Commissioner to establish OPR and any other offices within IRS to administer and enforce the regulations. However, Circular 230 does not include a requirement for practitioners concerning the security of taxpayer information. In recent years, IRS has taken a number of steps to help battle identity theft refund fraud. In 2015, IRS formed the Security Summit, a public-private partnership to protect the nation’s taxpayers and the tax system from identity theft refund fraud. The summit has representatives from IRS, state tax administrators, and industry partners including the software industry, tax professional associations, and payroll and tax financial product processors. IRS launched ISAC in the 2017 filing season. It aims to allow IRS, states, and tax preparation industry partners to quickly share information on identity theft refund fraud. It includes two components: an online platform controlled by IRS to communicate data on suspected fraud, and a collaborative organization governance structure comprising IRS, states, and industry. IRS uses a Rapid Response Team in partnership with states and industry members to coordinate responses to identity theft refund fraud incidents. The team aims to respond to significant threats within 24 to 72 hours of their discovery. The Rapid Response Team was deployed for six incidents in 2016, one in 2017, and was not deployed for any incidents in 2018. IRS seeks to help safeguard taxpayers’ information and the electronic filing system by prescribing requirements for various types of third-party providers through its Authorized e-file Provider program. These requirements are outlined in Revenue Procedure 2007-40 and Publication 1345, Handbook for Authorized IRS e-file Providers of Individual Income Tax Returns. IRS Revenue Procedure 2007-40 states that the security of taxpayer accounts and personal information is a top priority for the agency. Further, the Revenue Procedure states that it is the responsibility of each IRS Authorized e-file Provider to have security systems in place to prevent unauthorized access to taxpayer information by third parties. Some of the requirements included in this program are applicable to all types of Authorized e-file Providers, while others are applicable to one group or another. Businesses—including sole proprietors—that wish to e-file tax returns on behalf of clients must apply to IRS’s Authorized e-file Provider program and choose a provider type, as described in table 2. According to IRS, in 2018 there were more than 325,000 Authorized e-file Providers, some of which were paid preparers. More than 790,000 paid preparers had registered with IRS as of 2018; accordingly, not all paid preparers are Authorized e-file Providers and are therefore not covered by the requirements of the Authorized e-file Provider program. However, a business that has been approved as an electronic return originator (ERO) may employ multiple paid preparers who are not Authorized e-file Providers. Those paid preparers would be allowed to e-file returns under the supervision of their ERO employer. According to IRS Publication 3112, the activities and responsibilities for return preparation and e-filing are distinct and different from each other. Tax software providers, which IRS refers to as software developers in its Authorized e-file Provider program, develop tax return software that individuals and businesses can use to file their own returns, or that paid preparers can use when filing returns on behalf of clients. Online providers are the subset of tax software providers that allow individual taxpayers to self-prepare returns and file them with IRS. Providers that develop software for paid preparers’ use do not fall under the definition of an online provider. IRS has not fully incorporated the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Safeguards Rule into its requirements for all provider types under the Authorized e-file Provider program. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act provided FTC with the authority to require that financial institutions subject to its jurisdiction ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and nonpublic personal information; protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security of such records; and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information which could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. FTC, in turn, issued a regulation known as the “FTC Safeguards Rule.” The FTC Safeguards Rule applies to financial institutions including third- party providers that help taxpayers file tax returns, such as paid preparers and providers of software that allows individuals to prepare their own tax returns. The FTC Safeguards Rule requires those institutions to develop, implement, and maintain a comprehensive written information security program. The program must contain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that are appropriate to the provider’s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the provider’s activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. IRS addresses the FTC Safeguards Rule through its Revenue Procedure 2007-40. This Revenue Procedure provides the procedures for the Authorized e-file Provider program, and clearly states that violations of the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the implementing rules and regulations promulgated by FTC are considered violations of the Revenue Procedure. It also states that violations may subject an Authorized e-file Provider to penalties or sanctions, including suspension or expulsion from the Authorized e-file Provider program. However, the IRS publications that provide further information on the Authorized e-file Provider program only briefly discuss the FTC Safeguards Rule, and do not provide details on the required elements of an information security program. For example: Publication 3112, IRS e-file Application and Participation, states that providers should become familiar with the Privacy and Security Rules that implement the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and with other important information regarding the safeguarding of personal information available on the FTC website. The publication does not detail each of the required elements of an information security program. Publication 1345, Handbook for Authorized IRS e-file Providers of Individual Income Tax Returns, which was updated in February 2019, notes FTC’s role in protecting taxpayer data and generally describes the requirement of implementing and maintaining a comprehensive information security program, including the requirement that administrative, technical, and physical safeguards be appropriate to the business’s size, nature and scope of its activities, and the sensitivity of the customer information. The publication does not detail each of the required elements of an information security program. We identified other IRS publications that are not exclusively related to the Authorized e-file Provider program that discuss the requirements of the FTC Safeguards Rule, as well as other information security measures that serve as leading practices for the broader population of tax professionals. For example, in 2018, IRS updated Publication 4557, Safeguarding Taxpayer Data: A Guide for Your Business. The publication aims to help tax professionals understand basic security steps, recognize signs of data theft, respond to data losses, and understand and comply with the FTC Safeguards Rule. This publication refers to the FTC rule and tax professionals’ responsibilities to create and enact security plans, and provides a checklist from FTC to help third-party providers implement the information security plans. IRS Publication 4600, Tips for Safeguarding Taxpayer Data, also discusses elements of the FTC Safeguards Rule. However, while IRS references these documents in Publications 3112 and 1345, Authorized e-file Providers are not obligated to consult or follow these documents. In addition, most paid preparers do not know about the FTC Safeguards Rule and likely do not have information security plans for their places of business, according to officials from several tax preparation industry groups. Industry group officials also told us that there are misconceptions about who should be responsible for implementing information security. For example, one industry group official said that paid preparers and EROs often think that their tax software providers will provide security services or that their computer firewall or antivirus software will be enough protection. Modifying the Authorized e-file Provider program requirements to explicitly incorporate the FTC Safeguards Rule’s elements of an information security program would be consistent with Internal Control Standards. The standards call for management to consider the external requirements—such as laws, regulations, and standards—and incorporate these requirements into an agency’s objectives when setting the standards for the compliance of other entities. IRS officials told us that they do not believe that federal law provides IRS with any authority to enforce the FTC Safeguards Rule. However, IRS has already stated in Revenue Procedure 2007-40 that compliance with the FTC Safeguards Rule is required for participation in the Authorized e- file Provider program. Modifying its requirements to explicitly state the elements of an information security program as required under the FTC Safeguards Rule would help IRS ensure that all types of Authorized e-file Providers are aware of, and comply with, the FTC Safeguards Rule, which could help them better protect taxpayers’ information. While modifying the Authorized e-file Provider program may not reach paid preparers who are not part of the Authorized e-file Provider program, it will strengthen the controls for EROs, tax software providers, and online providers. IRS’s Authorized e-file Provider program does not outline a set of minimum information security standards for systems used by paid preparers or Authorized e-file Providers. When we reviewed IRS’s publications for Authorized e-file Providers, we found that specific information security standards were outlined for online providers, but there were no specific standards for other types of Authorized e-file Providers or paid preparers. Officials from tax preparation groups we interviewed and IRS raised issues that relate to paid preparers’ system risks. First, the tax preparation industry groups that we spoke with stated that most paid preparers, especially small firms or individual preparers, did not know the steps that they should take to protect taxpayer information on their systems. IRS officials reported that paid preparers often do not know that they experienced a security incident until IRS informs them something is wrong with their filing patterns. Second, according to officials from several tax preparation industry groups, paid preparers often have several misconceptions as to what is required of them in protecting taxpayer data, causing confusion. Industry group officials we interviewed told us that IRS’s current publications are not clear about requirements versus leading practices. For example, IRS publication 4557, Safeguarding Taxpayer Data, provides paid preparers with some leading practices to protect taxpayer data, but the leading practices are not legal requirements, with the exception of the FTC Safeguards Rule. An official from the Return Preparer Office explained that imposing any standards for paid preparers, whether related to competency or information security, without explicit authority would leave IRS vulnerable to legal challenges because of a recent court case that found that IRS does not have the authority to regulate the competency of paid preparers. According to IRS’s Office of Chief Counsel, this ruling, combined with the lack of explicit statutory authority, prevents IRS from establishing system standards for paid preparers, because while 31 U.S.C. § 330 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to regulate the practice of practitioners before the Department of the Treasury, mere return preparation, including through systems practitioners use to prepare and transmit tax returns, is not considered practice before IRS. In contrast to paper filing of tax returns, certain security measures need to be taken for e-filing returns to protect the integrity of the e-file system; thus, IRS has implicit authority to regulate e-file providers insofar as their activities relate to electronically filing returns with IRS, according to IRS Office of Chief Counsel officials. These officials also noted that no single provision of the Internal Revenue Code provides IRS explicit authority to regulate the standards for e-file providers. Instead, Internal Revenue Code § 7803 gives the Commissioner of Internal Revenue broad authority to administer and supervise the internal revenue laws, and § 6011 authorizes IRS to require returns and regulate the form of such returns. When taken as a whole, these provisions of the Internal Revenue Code show congressional intent to provide the Secretary of the Treasury with broad authority to administer the method for, and requirements surrounding, the e-filing of federal tax returns, according to IRS officials. Nevertheless, having explicit authority to establish security standards for the systems of Authorized e-file Providers may help IRS better ensure the protection of taxpayers’ information and mitigate the risk of legal challenges to IRS’s ability to do so. IRS Office of Chief Counsel officials also noted that for several years the Department of the Treasury has sought additional authority for IRS to regulate all tax return preparers. For example, this request was included in the most recent (fiscal year 2020) Congressional Budget Justification. The justification for this additional authority specifically refers to the competency of tax return preparers, but does not mention security standards for the systems that those preparers use. Similarly, we have previously suggested that Congress consider granting IRS the authority to regulate the competency of paid preparers (that suggestion did not cover regulating the security of paid preparers’ systems). As of April 2019, Congress had not provided such authority. Without Congress providing IRS with explicit authority to regulate the security requirements for the systems of paid preparers or Authorized e- file Providers, Congress and IRS have limited assurance that the processes used by paid preparers or Authorized e-file Providers are adequately protecting taxpayers’ information against electronic data breaches and potential identity theft tax refund fraud. Having such explicit authority would enable IRS to establish minimum security requirements and help ensure improved taxpayer information security by paid preparers and Authorized e-file Providers. IRS does not have a robust set of information security requirements for all tax software providers in the Authorized e-file Provider program. Instead, IRS has limited security requirements for the subset of tax software providers designated as online providers outlined in IRS Publication 1345, as we discuss in the next section. In Publication 4164, Modernized e-File Guide for Software Developers and Transmitters, IRS also provides some information on “security directive rules of behavior for accessing IRS business systems” while transmitting returns to IRS. However, this document does not provide a specific list of controls to for these providers to follow. IRS has been working with the Security Summit to implement a subset of the NIST Special Publication 800-53 security and privacy controls for the industry members of the Security Summit, which represents a subset of all tax software providers. The Security Summit partners agreed voluntarily to implement about 140 tax-related controls over a 3-year period and provide self-assessments related to the implementation of those controls. IRS reported in October 2018 that 15 of the 21 Security Summit industry partners had voluntarily certified that they implemented the NIST controls in years 1 and 2 of the rollout schedule. IRS officials reported that they later determined three of the other 21 industry partners are financial institutions that do not handle taxpayer data; thus the standards are not applicable to them. IRS officials told us that they are actively following up with the remaining three providers to determine why they have not completed and submitted the self-assessment, and to what degree they have implemented the subset of NIST security controls. While this is an important and significant first step, the 15 industry partners in the Security Summit that are voluntarily adhering to the NIST security controls represent about a third of all of the tax software providers that IRS has approved to be a part of the Authorized e-file Provider program. According to IRS, these 15 Security Summit partners transmitted about 132.6 million (98.8 percent) of all of the electronically filed returns in 2018; the other two-thirds of tax software providers in the Authorized e-file Provider program transmitted about 1.6 million (1.2 percent) electronically filed returns. A Security Summit membership criterion states that only those providers that filed more than 50,000 returns with IRS during a filing season can be members, but not all tax software providers meet this threshold. Internal Control Standards state that managers consider external requirements when defining objectives, such as those set by standard- setting bodies designed to comply with laws, regulations or standards. Management should incorporate those requirements into its objectives and sets those requirements through the established standards of conduct, oversight structure, organizational structure and expectations of competence. By statue, NIST is responsible for developing information security standards and guidelines, including minimum requirements for federal information systems. According to Special Publication 800-53, the controls outlined provide a holistic approach to information security and risk management by providing organizations with the breadth and depth of security controls necessary to fundamentally strengthen their information systems and the environments in which those systems operate—contributing to systems that are more resilient in the face of cyber attacks and other threats. While the guidelines in this publication are applicable to all federal information systems, other organizations are encouraged to consider using the guidelines, as appropriate. The applicability of the selected NIST controls is evidenced by the adoption of those controls by the Security Summit partners. While most returns are filed through tax software providers that are voluntarily adhering to the security controls, these controls are not required and do not apply to all tax software providers. Additionally, IRS officials that are a part of the Security Summit stated that they cannot enforce the subset of NIST controls with the remaining Security Summit partners because the controls were set up in a voluntary program. IRS officials from multiple offices did not have a clear reason as to why this subset of NIST controls has not been incorporated into the requirements for the entire population of tax software providers in the Authorized e-file Provider program, even though some security standards had been incorporated into the Authorized e-file Provider program for a limited set of providers (online providers) as discussed in the next section. In addition, as previously discussed, IRS can prescribe the requirements to which Authorized e-file Providers must adhere when e-filing returns for taxpayers. Incorporating fundamental security controls into its Authorized e-file Provider program would give IRS greater assurance that tax software providers have identified and addressed information security risks consistent with professional standards. This missed opportunity to update the requirements for tax software providers by adopting the subset of NIST controls is due, in part, to IRS’s lack of a centralized leadership over the security of taxpayer information collected by paid preparers and tax software providers. As previously discussed, multiple IRS offices have discrete responsibilities for overseeing the security of taxpayer information while at third parties; however, no one office is responsible for, or has the authority to provide, the strategic vision, oversight, or coordination over all aspects. Further, while IRS offices coordinate to some extent, there is not a formalized governance structure, such as a steering committee, that would help provide this level of leadership, coordination, and collaboration to the agency. According to Internal Control Standards, an agency’s organizational structure provides management’s framework for planning, directing, and controlling operations to achieve agency objectives. Management develops an organizational structure with an understanding of overall responsibilities, and assigns these responsibilities to discrete units to enable the organization to operate in an efficient and effective manner and reliably report quality information. A sound internal control environment requires that the agency’s organizational structure clearly defines key areas of authority and responsibility, and establishes appropriate lines of reporting. Without setting and requiring the same security standards for all tax software providers, IRS does not have assurance that these providers have an equivalent level of standards in place to adequately protect taxpayer information. Further, in continuing to operate a voluntary security controls program, IRS does not have assurance that those software providers who are currently adhering to the standards will continue to do so in the future. Finally, without centralized leadership in this area, it is unclear how IRS will adapt to changing security threats in the future and ensuring those threats are mitigated. Online providers—tax software providers that allow individuals to prepare their own tax returns—have additional requirements for security and privacy that they must follow, as outlined in Publication 1345. IRS established six security, privacy, and business standards for online providers, including requirements for developing information privacy and security policies and reporting security incidents. Compliance with these six standards for online providers became mandatory on January 1, 2010; however, IRS has not substantially updated them since then (see appendix II for the text of the six security, privacy, and business standards). These additional requirements do not apply to paid preparers, EROs, or providers of tax software used by paid preparers. Without updating standards regularly, the standards can become outdated and lose their ability to protect information from known vulnerabilities as technology changes. For example, IRS’s current guidance refers to an outdated encryption standard. Specifically, IRS requires online providers to use, at minimum, Secure Sockets Layer 3.0 and Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0. However, NIST Special Publication 800-52 and industry leading practices recommend the use of TLS 1.1 as the minimum level of encryption due to known weaknesses of using TLS 1.0 to encrypt data in transmission. While the standard allows for use of later encryption versions, it refers to a minimum encryption standard that has known weaknesses. As a result, IRS and taxpayers have limited assurance that their taxpayer data are protected according to NIST guidelines and industry leading practices. Recommended controls outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-53 and our Fraud Risk Framework call for continuous monitoring and regular fraud risk assessments, respectively, to help determine the effectiveness of controls in a program. Internal Controls Standards also calls for management to periodically review the policies, procedures, and related activities for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving the entity’s objectives or addressing related risks. When we asked why the six standards in Publication 1345 had not been updated since 2010, a senior Wage and Investment Division official stated that the publication is subject to an annual review by multiple IRS offices, but no office had identified the need to update the standards as part of these reviews. An Electronic Products and Support Services (EPSS) official told us that the standards were initially developed based on the latest technology at the time. However, according to this official, technology can become obsolete quickly, and adapting standards to keep pace with technological changes can require a lot of resources. Not updating the requirements for online providers again points to a missed opportunity due to IRS’s lack of a centralized leadership over the security of taxpayer information at paid preparers and tax software providers. In this case, centralized leadership may have identified the need to update the standards. Without periodically reviewing and updating the standards themselves, IRS has limited assurance that the standards have kept pace with technological changes, and therefore, that the online providers are protecting the taxpayer’s data. IRS uses a variety of outreach tools to communicate with third-party providers, such as paid preparers and tax software providers, about information security risks. IRS tries to educate these tax professionals about ways to improve information security practices and the benefits of doing so. For example, IRS informs paid preparers, tax software providers, and others about the importance of reporting security incidents in a timely manner to help ensure that action can be taken quickly to help protect their clients and avoid fraudulent returns being filed. Similarly, Stakeholder Liaison advises paid preparers about the steps to take to ensure that their systems are no longer vulnerable to compromise, according to Stakeholder Liaison officials. Below are examples of IRS’s recent communication efforts. IRS and the Security Summit collaborated on tax professional outreach campaigns. For example, in 2018, they launched the Tax Security 101 campaign, which provided tax professionals with basic information on how to protect taxpayer data. Each year, IRS sponsors nationwide tax forums largely targeted toward paid preparers such as enrolled agents, certified public accountants, and noncredentialed preparers. The 2018 forum included five seminars focused on securing taxpayer information, such as “Data Privacy and Cybersecurity for Tax Professionals” and “Data Compromises—It’s Not a Matter of ‘If’ but ‘When.’” IRS hosts webinars throughout the year to inform tax professionals and taxpayers about various topics, including information security. For instance, in October 2018, IRS hosted a webinar called “Protect Your Clients, Protect Yourself: Tax Security 101.” The webinar covered common security threats, signs of data theft, ways to report taxpayer data theft to IRS, and tax preparers’ obligations to create a written information security plan consistent with the FTC Safeguards Rule. Stakeholder Liaison has participated in over 1,000 virtual and in- person events since June 2015 where data security was a primary topic or featured message, according to Stakeholder Liaison officials. Further, the officials reported that there were over 165,000 attendees at these events. IRS uses social media outlets such as YouTube and Twitter to provide information to tax professionals. For example, in July and October 2017, IRS released two YouTube videos about information security for tax professionals titled “Why Tax Professionals Need a Security Plan” and “What to Do After a Tax Professional Data Compromise.” Similarly, IRS’s tax professional Twitter account, @IRStaxpros, releases information about information security (see figure 4). Though IRS has various ways to disseminate information to tax professionals, it faces a challenge reaching paid preparers who are not affiliated with larger industry groups or who do not visit the IRS.gov website, according to both IRS officials and industry group officials. According to Return Preparer Office officials, many paid preparers are not linked to standard tax communication channels, such as direct communications from IRS through news releases or email alerts. IRS and industry group officials told us one barrier to reaching these paid preparers is preparers’ belief that their businesses are too small to be a target for fraudsters. IRS officials recognize the challenges and said that they continue to address them by speaking with tax professionals about how to increase paid preparers’ awareness of information security risks, such as by making materials easy for preparers to read. IRS’s monitoring program is primarily focused on EROs’ adherence with multiple aspects of the Authorized e-file Provider program, such as requirements for Earned Income Tax Credit due diligence, advertising, and electronic signatures. The monitoring program also calls for monitoring of physical information security, which is not required as part of the Authorized e-file Provider program. The Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) details mechanisms and practices for monitoring Authorized e-file Providers, including EROs and online providers. As part of this monitoring, Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE) conducts field visits, the number of which more than doubled in the past few years, from almost 300 in 2015 to about 650 in 2018. SB/SE revenue agents visit providers to monitor their operations and to advise providers of any program violations. IRS uses monitoring visits to investigate allegations, complaints, and warnings against Authorized e-file Providers, as well as to determine general compliance with program requirements. While any provider type could undergo a monitoring visit, IRS officials informed us that they primarily conduct field monitoring visits for EROs, which are selected using risk-based criteria. According to these officials, SB/SE coordinates with other IRS offices to provide field monitoring on an as-needed referral basis for other types of Authorized e-file Providers. IRS officials reported that they were unable to confirm the specific number of recent referral monitoring visits but said there were likely fewer than five referrals in the past couple of years. However, the IRM section detailing the monitoring visits provides little direction for monitoring of information security standards from IRS Publication 1345. The IRM lists monitoring techniques for security, but they focus largely on physical security rather than cybersecurity controls for the electronic aspects of information security. For example, the IRM suggests that agents ask about access to physical files or office keys rather than about how providers send emails containing taxpayer information. According to our Fraud Risk Framework, agencies should use a risk- based approach to evaluate outcomes and adapt activities to improve fraud risk management. As fraudsters increasingly target paid preparers and tax software providers through cybersecurity attacks, risk-based monitoring and evaluation of cybersecurity controls could help IRS identify fraud risks and potential control deficiencies among third-party providers. IRS officials said that the SB/SE revenue agents who conduct monitoring visits do not have the technical expertise to effectively monitor information security or cybersecurity controls. For example, an IRS official stated that the IRM monitoring techniques ask about physical security instead of cybersecurity because revenue agents can verify whether filing cabinets are locked or whether computer passwords are visible, but they cannot verify cybersecurity controls, such as whether a provider’s information security policies are consistent with government and industry guidelines. Further, an SB/SE official said that, while SB/SE is responsible for monitoring Authorized e-file Providers, cybersecurity is not part of SB/SE’s role. However, we believe there are opportunities for revenue agents to ask basic cybersecurity questions and, at a minimum, use monitoring visits to help promote awareness of leading practices designed to help protect taxpayer information. For example, revenue agents could ask providers if they have secured their office’s wireless capabilities, use encryption for sensitive business information, have a designated official in case of a security incident, or know their assigned stakeholder liaison, among other things. Additionally, opportunities exist to leverage resources across IRS to monitor cybersecurity controls. For instance, Cybersecurity has technical expertise that SB/SE could leverage to help monitor these requirements, according to a Cybersecurity official. Without effective monitoring of information security standards or cybersecurity controls, IRS has limited assurance that EROs’ systems are adequately protecting taxpayers’ information. If these third parties do not adequately protect that information, taxpayers will face increased risk of both tax-related and non-tax-related identity theft. Improved monitoring could help IRS ensure that it is more effectively detecting and responding to changing fraud risks among providers. Additionally, updating documentation of monitoring activities, as needed, such as the IRM and internal guidance, along with staff training, would provide IRS with better assurance that the greatest risk areas are addressed appropriately. IRS conducts limited monitoring of the online provider subset of tax software providers enrolled in the Authorized e-file Provider program. However, these monitoring efforts are not part of the systematic Authorized e-file Provider monitoring program for EROs described above, nor are they documented in the IRM or relevant job aids. According to EPSS officials, IRS does not currently monitor all of the standards for online providers. IRS staff can remotely monitor three of the six security, privacy, and business standards for online providers through electronic means, according to EPSS officials (see table 3). EPSS officials stated that the other three standards cannot be monitored remotely (see appendix II for the full text of the six security, privacy, and business standards). For two of the three standards that cannot be monitored remotely, EPSS officials said it would be feasible for online providers to send the results of vulnerability scans (standard 2 in table 3) and privacy seal vendor certifications (standard 3 in table 3) to IRS for monitoring purposes. However, according to these officials, EPSS does not have dedicated staff who could review these results. Similarly, SB/SE, which conducts Authorized e-file Provider monitoring, does not have the technical expertise to review these results, as previously discussed. In addition, IRS cannot monitor the requirement to report security incidents, according to officials, because there is no way for the agency to know whether security incidents have occurred but were not reported. However, every fiscal year, IRS asks online providers to self-certify that they are meeting all six of the security, privacy, and business standards in IRS Publication 1345, according to an EPSS official. To self-certify, providers answer “yes” or “no” questions about whether they have complied with each standard. According to this official, companies generally indicate that they are meeting all of the standards. In addition to inconsistent monitoring of online provider requirements, IRS has not recently assessed the information security risks among all third- party provider types. IRS initially implemented the Authorized e-file Provider monitoring program described above only for EROs because they presented the greatest risk for fraud, according to an EPSS official. However, IRS’s monitoring practices and the associated IRM section have not been updated since 2011, and still reflect IRS’s initial assumption that EROs present the greatest risk for fraud among the different provider types. Additionally, while IRS assessed the security and privacy risks of tax software providers, the assessment did not compare these risks to those presented by EROs. In 2009, we recommended that IRS assess the extent to which the reliance on tax software creates significant risks to tax administration, including the security and privacy of taxpayer information. IRS agreed with our recommendation and in 2011 received the results of a third-party risk assessment to determine, in part, the security and privacy risks presented by large and small software providers. The assessment found that security presented the biggest overall risk among the areas reviewed—security of information, privacy of information, accuracy of returns, and reliability of systems—due, in part, to security being the least adequately controlled risk area by small software providers. This assessment was not designed to review the risks for other Authorized e-file Provider types, such as EROs. Our Fraud Risk Framework requires agencies to plan regular fraud risk assessments and suggests tailoring those assessments to the program. Effective managers plan to conduct such assessments at regular intervals and when there are changes to the program or operating environment, such as changes in technology that could result in increased security incidents. As part of a risk assessment, managers may examine the suitability of existing fraud controls. Such examination can help managers identify areas where existing control activities are not suitably designed or implemented to reduce risks to a tolerable level. By conducting a risk assessment for the Authorized e-file Provider program and identifying the provider types that present the greatest risks for fraud, IRS can better determine whether changes to the monitoring program are needed for each provider type. If the agency determines that changes are needed, updating documentation of monitoring activities— such as the IRM, internal guidance, and job aids, along with staff training—would provide IRS with better assurance that the greatest risk areas are addressed appropriately. Multiple offices within IRS use information on security incidents to track trends in fraud schemes, which helps them to protect taxpayer information and to prevent the filing of fraudulent tax returns. For example, when Stakeholder Liaison receives reports about a security incident involving a paid preparer, staff collect additional information about the incident, including the cause of the incident and whether taxpayer information was compromised. Stakeholder Liaison can analyze the data to show geographical information, like the states most affected by breaches; the paid preparer types most affected by incidents; and the method of attack of incidents; among other things, according to a Stakeholder Liaison official. This official said that Stakeholder Liaison also uses this information to produce daily management reports to keep leadership apprised of the number of incidents reported daily, as well as the cumulative number of affected preparers and taxpayers during the year and a comparison to data from the previous year. Return Integrity and Compliance Services (RICS) officials use a risk- based method to determine the necessary mitigation and treatment plans following a security incident. For example, RICS officials might assess a security incident as high risk, meaning that a taxpayer’s personal, financial, and tax data were compromised. For such an incident, RICS officials place the affected Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) on Dynamic Selection Lists—lists of TINs affected in breaches and at risk of tax-related identity theft—to monitor future tax return filings for potential fraud. On the other hand, for low-risk incidents—incidents where fraudsters may have accessed information like street address or date of birth but not Social Security numbers—RICS may compare victims’ current tax returns with prior returns to look for differences that could indicate possible identity theft. According to RICS officials, the office also runs individuals’ information through fraud filters to help identify returns with a high likelihood of identity theft. Criminal Investigation’s (CI) Cybercrimes unit shares security incident information with the field offices where the incident occurred, according to CI officials. Area coordinators evaluate the incident information and determine whether a criminal case should be developed. If so, coordinators develop a fraud scheme package and provide it to the agent assigned to the case to help identify other potential incidents resulting from similar schemes, according to CI officials. IRS has primarily tracked information on security incidents in its RICS Incident Management Database since December 2016, according to RICS officials. Security incidents can be categorized in a number of ways, such as when hackers infiltrate third-party providers’ systems. Between 2017 and 2018, there was an overall decrease in the number of reported high-risk security incidents that led to confirmed identity theft victims across all types of security incidents. However, the number of reported security incidents from third-party providers increased about 50 percent during this same period, as shown in table 4. In turn, the number of taxpayers affected by the security incidents at third-party providers also increased. However, IRS does not have comprehensive information about the incidents because, in part, its reporting requirements do not apply to all third-party providers. For example, the Authorized e-file Provider program requires only online providers to report security incidents to IRS as soon as possible but no later than the next business day after confirmation of the incident. The information that online providers are to report includes details about the security incident and the affected taxpayers’ accounts. If paid preparers or EROs experience a security incident at their place of business, they are not required to report any information to IRS about the incident; instead, IRS encourages paid preparers to share security incident information with IRS through Stakeholder Liaison. Additionally, IRS cannot track incidents that third-party providers do not report, according to IRS officials. IRS officials and industry representatives stated that some third-party providers may not report security incidents for fear of punishment from IRS (e.g., penalties, sanctions, or removal from the Authorized e-file Provider program) or negative impacts to their business reputation. IRS has other voluntary reporting mechanisms for tax software providers or other members of the tax preparation industry. For example, members of the Security Summit can use a voluntary reporting mechanism to submit information to RICS. Some members of the Security Summit can use an additional voluntary reporting system in the ISAC online platform, which sends alerts about security incidents to others in the platform. IRS also recently revised some of its requirements that could affect paid preparers’ reporting of security incidents while using other IRS services. For example, in October 2018, the agency updated its user agreement for e-Services, a suite of web-based tools that allow paid preparers, among others, to complete transactions online with IRS. This update included a requirement to report any unauthorized use of the e-Services account or any other breach of security as soon as users become aware of the incident. According to Internal Control Standards, agencies should use quality information, both internal and external, to achieve objectives. For example, agencies should obtain data on a timely basis so that they can be used for effective monitoring. Additionally, recommended controls in NIST Special Publication 800-53 require reporting of suspected security incidents by federal agencies and their subordinate organizations. Though IRS conducts a yearly review of requirements for Authorized e- file Providers to find needed updates, the incident reporting requirement has not been identified as needing updates since 2010, according to a senior Wage and Investment official. This is another instance where centralized leadership could have identified a need to update the incident reporting requirements. According to an EPSS official, IRS originally applied this incident reporting requirement to only online providers because these providers stored a large amount of data and carried the highest risk of data loss. Similarly, IRS officials said the reporting requirement for online providers does not apply to providers of tax software used by paid preparers because those software providers do not collect or store taxpayer information on their systems. Instead, the taxpayer information is stored on a paid preparer’s hard drive. If a security incident occurred at the business of a paid preparer who uses tax software, then the preparer, not the tax software provider, would report that incident to IRS, according to IRS officials. While voluntary reporting mechanisms and updating of user agreements for IRS’s website are important steps, without a clear and standardized reporting requirement for all types of providers, IRS will not have assurance that third-party providers consistently report their security incidents in a timely manner. IRS needs this information to better understand the size and scope of information security incidents, which it uses to protect compromised individual taxpayer accounts and prevent identity theft refund fraud. Security incident information can be reported to IRS through various channels from the public to IRS offices, and the data are ultimately stored in the RICS Incident Management Database regardless of the office that initially received the information. Figure 5 depicts the flow of information from the public to IRS offices, as well as the flow of information between the offices and to IRS databases. While RICS has documented its information intake, tracking, and storage processes in the RICS Incident Management Plan, IRS does not have a comprehensive document that describes these processes across the different IRS offices. For example, incident information submitted to EPSS and Stakeholder Liaison eventually moves to RICS to be tracked in the Incident Management Database. Additionally, RICS officials told us that they track each of these reported incidents separately and that the main repository should not contain duplicate reports of the same incidents, though multiple databases may contain information about the same incident. RICS officials added that, before a new incident is added to the Incident Management Database, staff conduct a query in the database to ensure that the incident was not already added. However, IRS has not documented how the security incident data processes should flow, relying instead on informal communication efforts of the staff and the assumption that staff know where the data belong and will provide that information to the appropriate offices. Internal Control Standards state that management should develop and maintain documentation of its internal control system and implement control activities through policies. The standards also state that documentation of responsibilities through policies and periodic review of activities can contribute to the effectiveness of implementation. This limited nature of the documentation may be due to the newness of some of these data processes. For example, a Stakeholder Liaison official told us that the data intake process for Stakeholder Liaison and entry into the Return Preparers Database started at the beginning of 2018. Prior to that, a Stakeholder Liaison manager stored information about security incidents in an individual email account because there was no mechanism for storing the data in a systematic manner. Further, a senior Wage and Investment Division official stated that the processes to intake, store, and share the data among the different IRS offices continue to evolve, and that documents describing these practices may quickly become obsolete. While these processes may still be evolving, documenting them can help IRS combat identity theft by helping to ensure that security incidents are properly recorded and monitored in the IRS systems. Documenting the processes may also allow for more complete data, as the data would follow a specific routing and review process. This would reduce the risk of the data not following the various channels they go through now. Such documentation can also help IRS retain organizational knowledge, mitigate the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel, and ensure that the agency implements these processes effectively in the future. Tens of millions of taxpayers use third-party providers, such as paid preparers or tax software providers, to comply with their federal income tax obligations. It is critical that taxpayers’ information, which includes personally identifiable and other sensitive information, be kept secure to maintain public confidence and avoid data breaches that expose that information for use by fraudsters. Identity theft is a constantly evolving crime, but IRS’s information security standards for third-party providers’ systems have not kept pace with the changing environment. One reason for this is that IRS lacks the explicit authority to require minimum standards for the systems of paid preparers and Authorized e-file Providers. Without this authority, Congress and IRS have limited assurance that the processes used to collect, store, and submit taxpayers’ returns adequately protect taxpayers’ information against electronic data breaches and potential tax refund fraud. Modifying its Authorized e-file Provider program requirements to explicitly state the elements of an information security program as required under the FTC Safeguards Rule would help IRS ensure that Authorized e-file Providers are aware of, and comply with, the rule. Doing so could also help these providers better protect taxpayers’ information. Additionally, IRS is missing an opportunity to capitalize on the achievements of Security Summit members to help ensure that tax software providers have an equivalent level of standards in place to adequately protect taxpayer information. The lack of centralized leadership at IRS with responsibility for coordinating all aspects of protecting taxpayer information held by third- party providers has enabled missed opportunities. Such designated leadership could help ensure greater collaboration between the various IRS offices that have roles to play in this area. This leadership could have also ensured that security standards for online providers in the Authorized e-file Provider program would have been updated. Instead, IRS introduced these standards in 2010 and has not subsequently updated them. Incorporating cybersecurity into its monitoring visits for EROs would provide IRS with greater assurance that EROs’ systems are adequately protecting taxpayers’ information from an increased risk of both tax- related and non-tax-related identity theft. Further, ensuring that IRS is using a risk-based approach to review all types of Authorized e-file Providers would provide assurance that the greatest risk areas of fraud are addressed appropriately. Finally, IRS’s efforts to protect taxpayer information at third-party providers would also be strengthened by greater consistency in requirements across provider types for reporting security incidents. Greater consistency would help to ensure IRS is obtaining timely and reliable information from third-party providers so IRS can better understand the size and scope of security incidents—data it uses to protect compromised individual taxpayer accounts and prevent identity theft refund fraud. Documenting the intake, storage, and sharing of the security incident data would also help IRS ensure that the security incidents are properly recorded and monitored. Congress should consider providing IRS with explicit authority to establish security requirements for the information systems of paid preparers and Authorized e-file Providers. (Matter for Consideration 1) We are making the following eight recommendations to IRS. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should develop a governance structure or other form of centralized leadership, such as a steering committee, to coordinate all aspects of IRS’s efforts to protect taxpayer information while at third-party providers. (Recommendation 1) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should modify the Authorized e- file Provider program’s requirements to explicitly state the required elements of an information security program as provided by the FTC Safeguards Rule. (Recommendation 2) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should require that all tax software providers that participate in the Authorized e-file Provider program follow the subset of NIST Special Publication 800-53 controls that were agreed upon by the Security Summit participants. (Recommendation 3) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should regularly review and update the security requirements that apply to tax software providers and other Authorized e-file Providers. (Recommendation 4) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should update IRS’s monitoring programs for electronic return originators to include techniques to monitor basic information security and cybersecurity issues. Further, IRS should make the appropriate revisions to internal guidance, job aids, and staff training, as necessary. (Recommendation 5) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should conduct a risk assessment to determine whether different monitoring approaches are appropriate for all of the provider types in the IRS’s Authorized e-file Provider program. If changes are needed, IRS should make appropriate revisions to the monitoring program, internal guidance, job aids, and staff training, as necessary. (Recommendation 6) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should standardize the incident reporting requirements for all types Authorized e-file Providers. (Recommendation 7) The Commissioner of Internal Revenue should document intake, storage, and sharing of the security incident data across IRS offices. (Recommendation 8) We provided a draft of this report to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for review and comment. In its written comments, which are summarized below and reproduced in appendix III, IRS agreed with three of the recommendations and disagreed with five of the recommendations. IRS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. IRS agreed with our recommendations to regularly review and update the security requirements that apply to the tax software provider and other Authorized e-file Providers; standardize the incident reporting requirements for all types of Authorized e-file Providers; and document intake, storage, and sharing of the security incident data across IRS offices. IRS did not provide additional detail on the actions it plans to take to address these recommendations. IRS disagreed with five of our recommendations, generally citing for all of them the lack of clear and explicit authority it would need to establish security requirements for the information systems of paid preparers and others who electronically file returns. For our recommendation to develop a governance structure or other form of centralized leadership, IRS stated it would require statutory authority that clearly communicates its authority to establish security requirements for the information systems of paid preparers and others who electronically file tax returns. Further, IRS stated that without such authority, implementing the recommendation would be an inefficient, ineffective, and costly use of resources. We disagree that convening a governance structure or other centralized form of leadership would require additional statutory authority or be inefficient, ineffective, and costly. As discussed in the report, IRS has seven different offices across the agency working on information security-related activities that could benefit from centralized oversight and coordination, such as updating existing standards, monitoring Authorized e-file Provider program compliance, and tracking security incident reports. We continue to believe that establishing a governance structure would help provide this level of leadership, coordination, and collaboration to IRS’s current efforts and therefore help alleviate the missed opportunities that we identified in the report, such as updating outdated security standards. Further, IRS could choose a leadership mechanism that it determines to be low cost and most efficient to gain a higher degree of coordination. Without this structure, it is unclear how IRS will adapt to changing security threats in the future and ensure those threats are mitigated. In our draft report, we made a recommendation that IRS modify the Authorized e-file Provider program to be consistent with the FTC Safeguards Rule. In its response, IRS stated that it did not have explicit authority to establish policy consistent with the FTC Safeguards Rule or enforce compliance with it. However, IRS clearly states in its Revenue Procedure 2007-40 that violations of the provisions of the Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act and the implementing rules and regulations promulgated by FTC are considered violations of the revenue procedure and may subject an Authorized e-file Provider to penalties or sanctions. Therefore, we believe IRS has already incorporated compliance with the FTC Safeguards Rule as part of its Authorized e-file Provider program. The intent of this recommendation is not to suggest that IRS develop new policies related to the elements of the Safeguards Rule. Instead, we believe IRS has the opportunity to explicitly state in its requirements for Authorized e-file Providers the elements of an information security program, as listed in the Safeguards Rule. This action will help third party providers become aware of their specific legal obligations to protect taxpayer data under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. As such, we clarified text in the body of the report and the text of the recommendation to better reflect our intent. For our recommendation to require all tax software providers that participate in the Authorized e-file Provider program to follow the subset of NIST Special Publication 800-53 controls that were agreed upon by the Security Summit participants, IRS stated that it does not have the statutory authority for such a requirement. However, under its existing authority, IRS has already established some information security requirements for a portion of tax software providers—those that are online providers. IRS has the opportunity to further establish standards for all tax software providers by incorporating the subset of NIST controls into its Authorized e-file Provider program, which would capitalize on the work it has completed with the Security Summit members. We continue to believe that without setting and requiring the same security standards for all tax software providers, IRS does not have assurance that these providers have an equivalent level of standards in place to adequately protect taxpayer information. For our recommendation that IRS update its monitoring programs for electronic return originators, IRS stated it does not have the statutory authority to establish policy on information security and cybersecurity issues, nor to enforce compliance if noncompliance is observed. However, as we reported, IRS already monitors physical aspects of information security, which goes beyond existing Authorized e-file Provider program requirements. Since most individuals now file tax returns electronically, having checks for physical security without comparable checks for cybersecurity does not address current risks, as cyber criminals and fraudsters are increasingly attacking third-party providers, as IRS has noted. We believe that incorporating some basic cybersecurity monitoring into the visits would provide IRS the opportunity to help inform the most vulnerable third-party providers of additional guidance and resources. For our recommendation to conduct a risk assessment to determine whether different monitoring approaches are appropriate for all of the provider types in the Authorized e-file Provider program, IRS stated that changes to the monitoring program would not have value to the overall program performance absent statutory authority. We disagree with this conclusion. As discussed in the report, IRS does not currently systematically monitor the existing security requirements for online providers, nor does it conduct information security or cybersecurity monitoring for all types of Authorized e-file Providers. We believe that IRS could conduct a risk assessment of its current monitoring program within existing statutory authority and make necessary changes that would provide better assurance that all types of providers are receiving some level of oversight and that IRS is addressing the greatest risk areas appropriately. We are sending copies to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of other Senate and House committees and subcommittees that have appropriation, authorization, and oversight responsibilities for IRS. We are also sending copies of the report to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and other interested parties. In addition, this report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-9110 or Lucasjudyj@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs are on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. Our objectives were to (1) assess what is known about the taxpayer information security requirements for the systems used by third-party providers, (2) describe Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) outreach efforts to third-party providers on the requirements, (3) assess IRS’s monitoring processes for ensuring third-party providers’ compliance with the requirements, and (4) assess IRS’s requirements for third-party provider security incident reporting and how IRS uses that information. To assess what is known about the taxpayer information security requirements for the systems used by third-party providers, such as paid preparers and tax software providers, we reviewed applicable laws and regulations such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and relevant portions of the Internal Revenue Code, including 26 U.S.C. § 6011. This section of the Internal Revenue Code prescribes the filing of income tax returns, as well as the electronic filing requirements for returns prepared by paid preparers. We reviewed 26 U.S.C. §7803, which provides that the IRS Commissioner has the authority to administer and manage the execution and application of tax laws, while balancing the rights of, among other things, confidentiality and privacy of the taxpayer. We also reviewed the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) Safeguards Rule, which requires financial institutions, including tax return preparers, affiliates, and service providers, to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information. This rule applies to those who are significantly engaged in providing financial products or services that include preparation and filing of tax returns. We reviewed IRS Revenue Procedure 2007-40, which informs Authorized e-file Providers of their obligations to IRS, taxpayers, and other participants in the Authorized e-file Provider program and outlines the rules governing filing electronically with IRS. We reviewed IRS publications describing the obligations in IRS’s Revenue Procedure 2007-40 and the requirements of the Authorized e- file Provider program, including IRS Publication 3112, IRS e-file Application and Participation, and IRS Publication 1345, Handbook for Authorized IRS e-file Providers of Individual Income Tax Returns. We assessed these documents to determine if the requirements for third- party providers were incorporating the laws and following leading practices as outlined by Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government (Internal Control Standards) and A Framework for Managing Fraud Risk in Federal Programs (Fraud Risk Framework). The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015, and Office of Management and Budget guidance implementing its provisions, affirm that agencies should adhere to the leading practices identified in our Fraud Risk Framework. We also compared the standards published in Publication 1345 for online providers to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-52: Guidelines for the Selection, Configuration, and Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementations to determine if the standards were following leading practices. We reviewed the subset of NIST Special Publication 800-53: Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations controls that the Security Summit members agreed to voluntarily implement. We also reviewed other IRS publications that provide third-party providers with descriptions of leading practices in keeping taxpayer information safe, including IRS Publication 4557, Safeguarding Taxpayer Data: A Guide for Your Business; IRS Publication 4600, Tips for Safeguarding Taxpayer Data; IRS Publication 5293, Protect Your Clients; Protect Yourself: Data Security Resource Guide for Tax Professionals; and IRS Publication 5294, Protect Your Clients; Protect Yourself: Data Security Tips for Tax Professionals. In assessing these documents, we identified the extent of consistency among publications. We interviewed IRS officials who were responsible for various aspects of IRS’s security requirements for paid preparers and tax software providers. We conducted semistructured interviews with the following 10 industry groups and related organizations that represented a cross section of the tax preparation industry to determine their knowledge about existing information security requirements. American Coalition for Taxpayer Rights American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Council for Electronic Revenue Communication Advancement Electronic Tax Administration Advisory Committee Federation of Tax Administrators National Association of Tax Professionals National Society of Tax Professionals We reviewed IRS organization documents, including organizational charts and associated Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) provisions for the offices that have responsibilities for securing taxpayer information. We reviewed the stated missions of the offices of Electronic Products and Services Support (EPSS); Small Business/Self-Employed; Return Integrity and Compliance Services (RICS); Criminal Investigation (CI); Return Preparer Office; Office of Professional Responsibility; Cybersecurity; and Stakeholder Liaison. We also interviewed officials from these offices to determine how they coordinated the responsibilities for overseeing the security of taxpayer data among the offices. We compared IRS activities to the Internal Control Standards that identify controls that help an entity adapt to shifting environments, evolving demands, changing risks, and new priorities. To describe the outreach efforts IRS takes for third-party providers, we reviewed IRS outreach documents such as publications, news releases, social media posts, emails, webinars, and online education campaigns. We interviewed IRS officials and conducted semistructured interviews with 10 industry groups and related organizations to determine IRS’s communication efforts related to security standard enforcement and identify potential challenges that IRS faces in its outreach. To assess IRS’s monitoring processes for ensuring third-party providers’ compliance with information security requirements, we reviewed the agency’s monitoring procedures for the Authorized e-file Provider program per Rev. Proc. 2007- 40; IRS Publication 3112, IRS e-file Application and Participation; and IRS Publication 1345, Handbook for Authorized IRS e-file Providers of Individual Income Tax Returns. We reviewed the IRM section related to Monitoring the IRS e-file Program, monitoring checklists, and related job aides to determine the extent to which monitoring practices address security requirements in IRS Publication 1345. We assessed IRS’s monitoring efforts against our Fraud Risk Framework’s principles to combat fraud in a strategic, risk- based manner. We also interviewed the IRS officials responsible for overseeing the monitoring program. To assess IRS’s requirements for third-party provider reporting of security incidents and how IRS uses that information, we reviewed IRS guidance about security incident reporting requirements. We analyzed IRS data on the number and type of security incidents tracked in the RICS Incident Management Database from 2017 and 2018, the only data available following its creation in December 2016. We interviewed RICS officials about the quality of data in this database and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to describe a minimum count of security incidents. Specifically, we asked about the responsibilities of officials collecting and using the data, the procedures in place to capture all reported data, and controls for ensuring the accuracy of the data and resolving any errors, among other things. We reviewed IRS guidance and program user agreements to determine security incident reporting requirements for third-party providers. We reviewed IRS process documentation and interviewed IRS officials from EPSS, RICS, CI, Return Preparer Office, Cybersecurity, and Stakeholder Liaison to determine the collection, routing, and storage processes for security incident information. We assessed IRS’s processes and documentation practices against leading practices outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-53 and Internal Control Standards. We interviewed IRS officials to identify ways that IRS uses this security incident information. We conducted semistructured interviews with the 10 industry groups and related organizations listed above to determine their knowledge about existing security incident reporting requirements. We conducted this performance audit from November 2017 to May 2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) mandated that online providers adhere to six privacy, security, and business standards as part of the Authorized e-file Provider program, as listed in table 6. These standards have not been updated since they were developed in 2010. In addition to the contact named above, Jeff Arkin (Assistant Director), Robyn Trotter (Analyst-in-Charge), Christina Bixby, Alyssia Borsella, Mark Canter, Jehan Chase, Larry Crosland, Ann Czapiewski, James Andrew Howard, Michele Fejfar, and Robert Gebhart made key contributions to this report.\n","   8  The Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act, as amended, is the main federal law governing state child-care programs for low-income working families. The act was reauthorized in 2014, and the reauthorization included a focus on improving the overall quality of child- care services and development of participating children. In September 2016, OCC published new rules (CCDF regulations) to provide clarity to states on how to implement this law and administer the program in a way that best meets the needs of children, child-care providers, and families. The CCDBG Act and CCDF regulations allow states flexibility in developing CCDF programs and policies that best suit the needs of children and parents within that state. According to OCC, these new rules also align child-care requirements with new Head Start regulations, including certain requirements for background checks, annual monitoring, and prelicensure inspections for some CCDF providers. OCC also added regulatory requirements for state lead agencies to describe in their State Plans effective internal controls that are in place to ensure integrity and accountability including 1. processes to ensure sound fiscal management, 2. processes to identify areas of risk, 3. processes to train child-care providers and staff of the lead agency and other agencies engaged in the administration of the CCDF about program requirements and integrity, and 4. regular evaluation of internal control activities. Lead agencies are also required to describe in their State Plans the processes that are in place to identify fraud or other program violations, and to investigate and recover fraudulent payments and to impose sanctions in response to fraud. OCC is a program office within ACF that works with the states to administer the CCDF program. OCC and states each have responsibility for overseeing and protecting the integrity of the CCDF program. Each state must develop, and submit to OCC for approval, a State Plan that identifies the purposes for which CCDF funds will be spent for a 3-year grant period and designates a lead agency responsible for administering child-care programs. To administer CCDF funds, federal law and regulations require that states report their CCDF expenditures and data on the number of children served by CCDF subsidies. The current reporting structure as described by OCC and ACF officials is shown in figure 1. To request funding from the CCDF, states submit a State Plan for administering their CCDF programs to OCC. OCC provides states with a Plan Preprint, which serves as a template and includes instructions and guidance on developing the State Plans and providing information required by law and regulations. Further, OCC has used the Plan Preprint to request additional information from the states. The Plan Preprint developed for fiscal years 2019–2021 State Plans consists of eight sections and is the first to include the new CCDF regulatory requirements, added in September 2016 as required by the 2014 reauthorization. One of the new requirements is for state lead agencies to describe in their State Plans effective internal controls that are in place to ensure integrity and accountability. In addition, OCC modified the Plan Preprint for fiscal years 2019–2021 State Plans to add the instruction requesting states to report information about the results of their program-integrity and fraud- fighting activities, in addition to providing descriptions of the activities themselves. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, through OCC, has the responsibility to approve State Plans that satisfy the requirements, and review and monitor state compliance with the approved State Plan. According to OCC officials, the Program Operations Division within OCC, in partnership with the OCC regional program unit staff (regional offices), reviews the State Plans and approves those that they determine have satisfied the requirements of the CCDBG Act and CCDF regulations. The CCDF has been designated as a high-priority program, as defined by OMB, under the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act of 2012 (IPERIA), meaning that it is a program susceptible to significant improper payments. Federal statutes require federal agencies to evaluate programs for improper-payment risk and, for programs susceptible to significant improper payments, to report on actions taken to reduce improper payments. CCDF regulations implement these requirements by requiring states to calculate and report estimates of their improper payments, including proposed actions to address sources of error. These reports are developed by the states on a 3-year rotational cycle, and HHS reports the aggregate results in its Agency Financial Report. The CCDF gross improper payment estimate for fiscal year 2019 is approximately $325 million, and the estimated improper payment rate is 4.53 percent. OCC oversees states’ compliance with the prescribed procedures for estimating improper-payment error rates by approving the preliminary documents, approving any changes to the case samples, conducting the Joint Case Reviews, and reviewing and approving the final State Improper Payments Report and CAP submissions. If a state reports an error rate at or above 10 percent, it must also submit a CAP, which includes detailed descriptions of specific activities planned to reach a targeted reduction in errors. It must then submit an update on its progress and a new CAP the following year if it has not completed the proposed corrective actions or if the error rate is still at or above 10 percent. The improper-payment reporting process is illustrated in figure 2. In fiscal year 2019, OCC launched a formal Monitoring System to review a selection of states annually over the course of the 3-year State Plan period. According to OCC officials, the three main purposes of the Monitoring System are to: (1) ensure compliance with the CCDBG Act, CCDF regulations, and the approved State Plans; (2) identify state technical-assistance needs; and (3) identify promising practices to inform continuous quality improvement. The Monitoring System focuses on 11 topic areas, which include program integrity and accountability. In addition, other topic areas include disaster preparedness, consumer education, and health and safety requirements. OCC officials told us that monitoring is completed on a rolling basis, and that they plan to monitor one-third of states each fiscal year, from fiscal years 2019 to 2021. According to OCC officials, they scheduled the monitoring to ensure that a state will not be submitting an improper- payment report in the same year that it participates in the monitoring. Figure 3 provides additional details regarding the OCC Monitoring System process, which includes an on-site visit to monitored states. Fraud and “fraud risk” are distinct concepts. Fraud risk exists when individuals have an opportunity to engage in fraudulent activity, have an incentive or are under pressure to commit fraud, or are able to rationalize committing fraud. Although the occurrence of fraud indicates there is a fraud risk, a fraud risk can exist even if fraud has not yet been identified or occurred. For example, suspicious billing patterns or complexities in program design may indicate a risk of fraud even though fraud has not been identified or occurred. When fraud risks can be identified and mitigated, fraud may be less likely to occur. According to federal standards and guidance, executive-branch agency managers are responsible for managing fraud risks and implementing practices for combating those risks. Specifically, federal internal control standards state that management should consider the potential for fraud when identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks. As part of these standards, management assesses risks the entity faces from both external and internal sources. In addition, in July 2015, GAO issued the Fraud Risk Framework, which provides a comprehensive set of key components and leading practices that serve as a guide for agency managers to use when developing efforts to combat fraud in a strategic, risk-based way. The Fraud Risk Framework describes leading practices in four components, as shown in figure 4. The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015, enacted in June 2016, required OMB to establish guidelines for federal agencies to create controls to identify and assess fraud risks, and design and implement antifraud control activities. The act further required OMB to incorporate the leading practices from the Fraud Risk Framework in the guidelines. In July 2016, OMB published guidance about enterprise risk management and internal controls in federal executive departments and agencies. Among other things, this guidance affirms that managers should adhere to the leading practices identified in the Fraud Risk Framework. As part of its oversight of states’ CCDF programs, OCC reviewed and approved State Plans for the current grant period (fiscal years 2019– 2021). However, OCC has not established written policies to guide staff review and approval of these State Plans, a process that occurs every 3 years. OCC’s lack of established policies limits its ability to ensure that staff follow appropriate protocols for consistency when reviewing and approving State Plans and to retain organizational knowledge in the event of staff turnover, which OCC noted as occurring during each review period. Further, OCC requested that states report information about the results of states’ program-integrity activities. However, most of the State Plans that it approved did not provide the results of states’ program- integrity activities as requested. OCC officials told us that they plan to continue to request that states report on the results of their program- integrity activities, but OCC has not identified what it considers to be “results” of program-integrity activities. Without taking additional steps to define its informational needs and encourage states to report the results of their program-integrity activities, OCC will not have this information to help determine whether states are effectively ensuring the integrity of the CCDF program. To provide oversight of states’ CCDF program-integrity activities, OCC reviewed and approved State Plans for the current grant period, covering fiscal years 2019–2021. To do so, OCC officials described to us a process that began with a high-level review of the draft State Plans submitted through an electronic system. After an initial review for completeness, OCC staff focused on the contents of the State Plans including states’ responsiveness to each requirement. For example, one requirement is to describe the processes that the state will use to identify risk in its CCDF program. OCC officials also stated that they consider clarity, consistency, and compliance when assessing State Plans. OCC officials also explained that they reviewed the responses to determine whether they were sufficiently detailed, and sought clarification from the states when necessary. OCC officials stated that, prior to the final approval of the State Plans, staff completed a validation form that consists of a table listing the State Plan subsections with checkboxes next to each subsection. Figure 5 outlines the timeline for review and approval of State Plans. OCC has developed a draft procedure for the State Plan review and approval process, but had neither finalized written policies before beginning its review of the fiscal years 2019–2021 State Plans, nor finalized written policies for future review periods that occur every 3 years. Instead, OCC officials told us that for the review and approval process completed in 2018, they provided their staff a variety of training materials and draft documents that encouraged discussion among those involved. These documents contained information and guidance on the process, such as explaining the overall operational processes for reviewing and approving State Plans and general roles and responsibilities. However, none of the documents were finalized as OCC’s written policies for staff to follow when implementing the fiscal years 2019–2021 State Plan review and approval process, or for subsequent review periods. In response to our request for finalized policies pertaining to how OCC reviewed and approved State Plans, OCC provided documents that have substantial limitations for explaining to OCC staff how they should review and approve State Plans. For example, OCC provided what it characterized as a three-page summary protocol, which, in part, contained a historical record of what occurred during the recently completed review period rather than guidance that would help OCC achieve its State Plan review objectives on a continuous basis. Specifically, the protocol describes the regular internal meetings and interactions that OCC staff had from September 2018 to December 2018. As such, the protocol does not describe the process that OCC staff should follow, or the meetings that should occur, when reviewing and approving State Plans in future years (i.e., on a continuous basis). OCC also developed in August 2018 a more-detailed draft procedure for reviewing and approving State Plans. The draft procedure contains information on the communication process between the central and regional offices, recognizes that there may be variation in internal processes among regional offices and from one review period to the next, and includes guidance on steps for resolving questions about State Plans, among other guidance. Unlike the three-page summary protocol, the draft procedure explicitly states its applicability to future review periods as well as the current State Plan review period, and therefore would have provided guidance for staff on a continuous basis had a finalized version been shared with staff and established as OCC’s written policies. However, because of the volume of work and differences in caseloads among regional offices, OCC officials stated that they did not share a finalized procedure with staff and that staff were neither expected nor required to use the draft procedure when conducting their review of State Plans for the fiscal years 2019–2021 review period. As such, this draft procedure did not represent the formal policies for staff to follow in performing their roles. In explaining why it relies on the three-page summary protocol and draft procedure rather than finalized written policies to guide its State Plan review and approval process, OCC officials stated that OCC needs flexibility in its policies during the review period. Specifically, there are staffing changes in both the central and regional offices for each State Plan review period, and having flexibility within the framework provided by the three-page summary protocol allows them to accommodate those changes. OCC officials noted that some of the processes are unique to each of the 10 regional offices because of differences in their structure, staffing, and caseloads. Likewise, OCC officials stated that the regional offices need flexibility to continuously adjust processes and timelines so that they can accommodate varying responsiveness from states, and evaluate the State Plans without undermining the flexibility afforded to states through the block grant. However, it is possible for OCC to establish written policies to guide processes that are common from one review period to the next, and across all regions, while still maintaining the necessary flexibility to accommodate staffing changes and regional differences, as it had already begun to do by developing its August 2018 draft procedure. In this regard, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should implement control activities through policies. In doing so, management communicates the policies to personnel so that personnel can implement the control activities for their assigned responsibilities. Further, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government includes minimum documentation requirements, such as that management develop and maintain documentation of its internal control system. An internal control system is a continuous built-in component of operations that provides reasonable assurance that an entity’s objectives will be achieved. Internal control is not one event, but a series of actions that occur throughout an entity’s operations. Further, internal control is recognized as an integral part of the operational processes management uses to guide its operations, and internal control is built into the entity as a part of the organizational structure to help managers achieve the entity’s objectives on an ongoing basis. As such, documentation of the internal control system should reflect a continuous, built-in component of operations rather than a historical record of a past event. Documentation also provides a means to retain organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel. OCC’s lack of established written policies limits its ability to ensure that staff follow appropriate protocols on a continuous basis when implementing the State Plan review and approval process, and limits its ability to provide a means to retain organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel. Without finalizing written policies, an effort that could include leveraging its previously developed August 2018 draft procedure, OCC risks losing that knowledge each time there are staffing changes among central and regional offices. In response to a 2016 HHS OIG report, OCC has attempted to collect information about the results of states’ program-integrity and fraud- fighting activities by adding a new instruction to the fiscal years 2019– 2021 Plan Preprint requesting states to report such information in their State Plans. Specifically, the HHS OIG recommended that collecting data on program-integrity and fraud-fighting results would be an important step in monitoring states’ efforts to safeguard the CCDF program. Additionally, OCC officials told us that obtaining information on the results of program-integrity activities is important for understanding national trends and helping to inform OCC’s technical assistance to states and ensure states’ accountability over their program-integrity activities. However, our review of 51 approved State Plans found that 43 State Plans (about 84 percent) did not report the results of program-integrity activities as requested (see fig. 6). The other eight states (about 16 percent) reported the results of program-integrity activities. State Plans must meet the requirements set forth in the law and the CCDF regulations to be approved. OCC officials told us that the State Plans were approved without the information on the results of program- integrity activities because, although there are instructions in the Plan Preprint for states to report this information, the CCDF regulations do not require it. Further, OCC officials told us that when OCC submitted the Plan Preprint to OMB for approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act, OCC had indicated that the program-integrity results would be collected on an informational basis, and states would not be required to provide this information. According to an OCC official, only portions of the Plan Preprint with instructions for states to report on the results of program- integrity activities were requested on an informational basis, and all other information in that section was required for approval of the State Plans. OCC officials also told us that OCC will continue to request that states report on the results of their program-integrity activities in the State Plans, but OCC has not defined what information it needs regarding the “results” of states’ program-integrity activities and has not communicated the need to states or its staff. OCC officials told us that they will ensure that states submit this information by providing guidance to states on the purpose of collecting this information. However, OCC was not able to provide us with a definition or examples of what it considers to be “results” of program- integrity activities that would be helpful for ensuring states’ accountability over their program-integrity activities. In addition, OCC officials said that OCC did not communicate to states that the information about the results of program-integrity activities was being requested on an informational basis only. According to OCC officials, OCC did not specifically communicate its intention to states because it wanted states to provide a response, if possible. Similarly, OCC had not developed any specific internal criteria for its staff to use when reviewing State Plans to determine whether certain responses were sufficient for their informational needs, such as to better understand national trends. OCC officials also stated that there was no internal written guidance explaining to OCC staff that such information was not required for State Plan approval. Rather, this standard was communicated to staff during weekly meetings. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should use quality information to achieve the entity’s objectives. In doing so, management identifies the information requirements needed and defines the information requirements at the relevant level and requisite specificity for appropriate personnel. Further, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should internally and externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve the entity’s objectives. In this context, after defining its informational needs regarding the results of program-integrity activities, OCC’s internal and external communication could include communication to the states, which are requested to include this information in the State Plans, and to its staff who will be responsible for analyzing this information. Until OCC defines what information it needs regarding program-integrity activity results, it will be limited in its ability to obtain quality information. By not communicating informational needs to states and staff, OCC will continue to lack quality information about the results of states’ program-integrity efforts and will not be able to use that information to analyze national trends and help ensure states’ accountability over their program-integrity activities, as described. Since 2013, seven states with improper-payment rates at 10 percent or above have submitted 14 corrective action plans (CAP) to OCC for review. However, OCC does not have any documented criteria to guide the review of the CAPs submitted by states to ensure the proposed actions are aimed at root causes of improper payments and are effectively implemented. OCC also has not documented the procedures it uses to follow up with states subject to CAPs, but said it is planning to. Federal improper-payment statutes require federal agencies to review programs susceptible to significant improper-payment risks and develop actions to reduce improper payments. For example, the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010 (IPERA) specifically requires agencies administering programs that are susceptible to significant improper payments, such as the CCDF, to report on actions the agency is taking to reduce improper payments. Because the CCDF is administered by states, this requirement is implemented in CCDF regulations by requiring states reporting improper-payment error rates at or above 10 percent to develop and implement CAPs. The OMB guidance implementing IPERA states that agencies should ensure that each corrective action is specifically aimed at a root cause of improper payments and that the actions are effectively implemented to prevent and reduce improper payments. According to this guidance, a root cause is something that would directly lead to an improper payment and, if corrected, would prevent the improper payment. In the proposed rulemaking in which OCC introduced the CAPs, OCC stated that the CAPs are intended to be comprehensive and detailed, so as to improve upon the descriptions of corrective actions already reported on a 3-year cycle, which sometimes lack detail or specificity. OCC officials told us that OCC reviewers use their CAP Review Tool to evaluate the CAPs for approval, which also lays out the protocol for conducting reviews. However, the CAP Review Tool does not require reviewers to document whether the corrective actions proposed by states are aimed at root causes of improper payments, or effectively implemented. Further, the written review procedure that accompanies the CAP Review Tool does not contain guidance for reviewers on evaluating whether corrective actions are aimed at root causes and are effectively implemented. OCC officials explained to us that, in their view, states are in the best position to identify the most-feasible approach to corrective actions based on their individual circumstances. We acknowledge that states should have flexibility to identify corrective actions based on their individual circumstances. However, according to OMB guidance, it is federal agencies that are to ensure that corrective actions are aimed at root causes of improper payments and effectively implemented. Further, in the proposed rulemaking in which OCC introduced the CAPs, OCC stated that it intended the CAPs to be used for OCC to hold states accountable as part of its compliance with IPERA. Accordingly, without providing additional guidance to its reviewers, OCC will lack assurance that states’ proposed corrective actions are aimed at root causes and effectively implemented. OCC officials also stated that the majority of the seven states subject to CAPs reduced their error rates over time, specifically to below 10 percent. OCC officials explained that this determination is based on the submission of the State Improper Payment Report for the next required reporting cycle or on states’ voluntarily conducting a review of a sample of cases and submitting the results to OCC to demonstrate they had reduced their error rate to below 10 percent. We did not independently corroborate OCC’s determination because assessing the reliability of the self-attested internal error-rate reviews conducted by certain states and reviewing this information was outside the scope of our work. However, as part of our review of the 14 CAPs that have been submitted to OCC in response to OCC’s improper-payment reviews since 2013, we found that one state was required to submit CAPs for 3 consecutive years and consistently proposed the same error-rate reduction targets, with different dates. This observation underscores the need to ensure the corrective actions a state proposes are specifically aimed at root causes of improper payments and are effectively implemented. OCC does not have guidance in place for its reviewers to determine whether the ongoing corrective actions a state proposes to reduce improper payments will be specifically aimed at root causes of improper payments and effectively implemented. This could leave the CCDF program at continued risk of improper payments. OCC does not have written policies for its CAP follow-up process or documentation that follow-up has been completed for past CAPs. OCC officials told us that they plan to develop such written policies, but officials did not specify a timeline for completion. OCC officials described their process used to monitor states while they are subject to a CAP, which includes additional contact when the same state has been subject to CAPs for consecutive years. This CAP follow-up process is illustrated in figure 7. According to OCC officials, OCC intends to develop written policies for the CAP follow-up process but did not provide a time frame for completion. This will include, at a minimum, a written protocol for the activities illustrated above, which will be included in the next revision of the instructions given to states for improper-payment reporting. According to OCC officials, each region currently has its own process for documenting discussions with CAP states. Having established written policies for the CAP follow-up process will help ensure that OCC’s oversight and monitoring of CAPs is carried out consistently. OCC officials told us that their Monitoring System, initiated in fiscal year 2019, plays a part in OCC’s role to ensure that states’ program-integrity activities are effective. According to OCC officials, OCC uses two tools as part of its Monitoring System—a Compliance Demonstration Packet and Data Collection Tool. States complete the Compliance Demonstration Packet to outline how they propose to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements and implementation of the approved State Plans throughout the Monitoring System’s phases. For example, to show effective internal controls are in place to ensure integrity and accountability, states may provide OCC with state or local policies and manuals (previsit phase), and may submit to interviews or provide system demonstrations (on-site visit phase). OCC staff use the Data Collection Tool to record comments about the evidence observed, and to note whether additional follow-up is needed. Both of these tools contain language indicating that the effectiveness of states’ program-integrity and fraud-fighting activities are evaluated by OCC staff. For purposes of the Monitoring System, OCC officials said that states have broad flexibility to propose, in the Compliance Demonstration Packet, what documents and evidence to provide. In addition, states have the flexibility to propose how the state will demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements. This includes the requirement to describe in its State Plan effective program-integrity control activities, which includes fraud-fighting activities. OCC officials further told us that OCC does not collect the same set of information or evidence across the country. Rather, OCC collects state-specific information based on what each individual state proposes. For example, the Compliance Demonstration Packet allows states to propose an approach for demonstrating their compliance with the requirement to describe in their State Plans effective internal controls that are in place to ensure integrity and accountability. OCC officials said the primary purpose of the Monitoring System is to ensure that states are in compliance with CCDF regulations and implementing the State Plans as approved, rather than to make an assessment of the efficacy of the State Plans. When we asked OCC officials how they determine whether a state has provided appropriate and adequate documentation for the purposes of the Monitoring System, these officials told us that staff develop specific questions for each state and look for evidence showing that states are implementing the State Plans as approved. For example, OCC officials might look for evidence of a state’s implementation of certain program-integrity activities described in its approved State Plan to verify that the activities described are in place. OCC officials also stated that staff decide what is acceptable through consensus and attempt to build consistency through internal discussions regarding the appropriateness of the material that states provide. However, there are no specific criteria to guide OCC staff’s assessment of the effectiveness of states’ program-integrity activities during these discussions. For example, there are no specific criteria to help OCC staff assess whether states’ implemented control activities are effective at identifying areas of risk. OCC officials stated that the CCDF regulations and the approved State Plans are the most-detailed criteria that they use to assess data collected for the Monitoring System. However, neither the CCDF regulations nor the State Plans include specific criteria for assessing whether the control activities are effective. OCC is responsible for monitoring states’ compliance with the CCDF regulations, and these regulations explicitly require that states describe in their State Plans “effective internal controls that are in place to ensure integrity and accountability.” According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, an effective internal control system has a monitoring component that is effectively designed, implemented, and operating. Additionally, a leading practice of the Fraud Risk Framework is to examine the suitability of existing fraud controls. Managers who effectively implement an antifraud strategy monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive activities in this strategy and take steps to help ensure external parties with responsibility over fraud control activities effectively implement those activities. Without developing and using criteria to assess whether states’ program-integrity control activities are effective, OCC cannot ensure that states’ internal controls for program integrity are effective. Likewise, without examining the suitability of, and monitoring the effectiveness of, the states’ fraud control activities, OCC will be challenged in effectively implementing an antifraud strategy to minimize the risk of fraud in the CCDF program. OCC developed the Grantee Internal Controls Self-Assessment Instrument (Self-Assessment Instrument) in 2010 and makes the technical-assistance tool available to the states through its website. In response to a 2016 HHS OIG report, ACF officials said that OCC would use the Self-Assessment Instrument to address the report’s recommendations to request that states examine the effectiveness of their program-integrity and fraud-fighting activities, and examine with states the benefits of expanding such activities. The Self-Assessment Instrument contains five sections: (1) Eligibility Determination and Review; (2) Improper Payment Case Review Process; (3) Fraud and Overpayment Prevention, Detection, and Recovery; (4) Federal Reporting; and (5) Audits and Monitoring. According to OCC officials, as of August 2019, 19 states have completed the Self-Assessment Instrument since its inception. OCC officials stated that use of the Self-Assessment Instrument is based entirely on states’ self-identified risks, and states are free to choose which, if any, of the sections to complete. OCC officials have noted benefits as a result of states completing the Self-Assessment Instrument. Specifically, OCC officials said that states have improved their implementation processes and policies, and improper-payment error rates have decreased. In addition to making the tool available to states, OCC officials told us that OCC also provides technical assistance in completing the Self-Assessment Instrument, which may include an on-site facilitated discussion. The facilitated discussion may cover areas including control activities to identify and prevent fraud, and strategies to investigate and collect improper payments. Following the on-site facilitated discussion, an OCC contractor compiles a report summarizing state-identified issues to address in states’ policies and procedures, according to one OCC official. However, OCC officials told us that states are not required to act on this report. In addition to the Self-Assessment Instrument, OCC has recently coordinated on the development of the Fraud Toolkit, which is a series of electronic spreadsheets that states can use to respond to questions about their fraud risk management activities—such as staff training, procedures for addressing suspected fraud, and program administration. The tools assign risk levels to these areas based on the state’s responses, and will also include recommended next steps for each of those areas and generate a report to summarize overall risk. For example, data from these tools would indicate whether states’ CCDF program staff are trained to identify forms, such as wage stubs or employer letters that may have been forged or altered. The data would also indicate whether the state has a fraud referral process in place to expedite investigations. OCC makes the Fraud Toolkit available for states to use upon request. However, other than making the tool available, OCC officials said that OCC does not usually have any further involvement in states’ use of the tool. OCC officials told us that they do not plan to use either the Self- Assessment Instrument or the Fraud Toolkit to collect data about states’ CCDF programs because both the Self-Assessment Instrument and the Fraud Toolkit are intended as primarily technical-assistance tools rather than monitoring tools or data-collection instruments. OCC officials also told us that, to formally collect information from states’ use of such tools, they would need to seek approval from OMB. OCC officials stated that OCC’s goal is to develop technical assistance that best meets the needs of the states, and not to impose additional reporting requirements on the states. Officials also noted a concern that states could cease to participate in or accept technical assistance if such assistance is seen as increasing reporting requirements. However, according to OCC officials, OCC has not conducted a cost-benefit analysis of collecting such information. Leading practices in the Fraud Risk Framework are to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of preventive activities; collect and analyze data; and adapt activities to improve fraud risk management. Further, although external parties—in this case, the state lead agencies—may be responsible for specific fraud control activities, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control system and evaluate the results. As part of these standards, management retains responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of internal control over the assigned processes performed by external parties. Management is responsible for meeting internal control objectives, and may decide how the entity evaluates the costs versus benefits of various approaches to implementing an effective internal control system. However, cost alone is not an acceptable reason to avoid implementing internal controls, and cost-benefit considerations support management’s ability to effectively design, implement, and operate an internal control system that balances the allocation of resources and other factors relevant to achieving the entity’s objectives. By not evaluating the feasibility of collecting information from the Self-Assessment Instrument or the Fraud Toolkit— such as evaluating the feasibility of doing so during its Monitoring System process—OCC may be missing an opportunity to monitor the effectiveness of the internal control system to help states adapt control activities to improve fraud risk management. As described above, OCC has developed several program-integrity activities that could help assess and manage fraud risk if they were part of an antifraud strategy. For example, the improper-payment reporting process and Monitoring System are not specific to fraud but may generate information relevant to fraud risks. However, according to OCC officials, ACF has not completed a fraud risk assessment for the CCDF, which would provide a basis for the development of an antifraud strategy that describes the program’s approach for addressing prioritized fraud risks identified, as described in the Fraud Risk Framework. The Assess component of the Fraud Risk Framework calls for federal managers to plan regular fraud risk assessments and to assess risks to determine a fraud risk profile. Furthermore, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should consider the potential for fraud when identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks. Leading practices for planning fraud risk assessments include tailoring the fraud risk assessment to the program and planning to conduct the assessment at regular intervals and when there are changes to the program or operating environment. The leading practices also include identifying the tools, methods, and sources for gathering information about fraud risks and involving relevant stakeholders in the assessment process. The Fraud Risk Framework also identifies leading practices for conducting fraud risk assessments and documenting the program’s fraud risk profile, as illustrated in figure 8. As discussed in the Fraud Risk Framework, the fraud risk profile provides a basis for managers to develop and document an antifraud strategy that describes the program’s approach for addressing prioritized fraud risks identified. According to ACF, there is currently a process in place at the ACF level that will lead to the development of a Fraud Risk Assessment. Specifically, ACF is in the process of developing a Fraud Risk Assessment template, which will include a program fraud risk profile. The CCDF will be part of the pilot program for this effort. The Fraud Risk Assessment template will consider the Fraud Risk Framework as well as guidance contained in OMB Circular A-123, Management’s Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Control, according to OCC officials. These officials also stated that ACF will leverage its previously developed and implemented risk assessments, including the Program Risk Assessment that was completed for the CCDF between fiscal years 2011 and 2016 as part of the HHS Program Integrity Initiative. However, according to ACF, the development of a Fraud Risk Assessment template is currently on hold due to competing priorities. The ACF stated the agency expects to resume the process by December 2019, and OCC expects that the draft template will be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Because the CCDF is serving as the pilot for the new template, OCC expects that the initial assessment of the program will be complete by the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. Until ACF finalizes its template and conducts a risk assessment for the CCDF, ACF will not be able to develop a fraud risk profile for the CCDF. The fraud risk profile is an essential piece of the antifraud strategy and informs the specific control activities managers design and implement. Although there is currently a process in place for ACF to develop a fraud risk assessment template, until ACF carries out the assessment of the CCDF and develops an associated fraud risk strategy, it will lack assurance that OCC’s program-integrity activities are suitable and targeted at prioritized fraud risks. Both state lead agencies and OCC play an important role in overseeing and protecting the integrity of the CCDF program. However, OCC has not finalized written policies that describes how staff should implement or document the State Plan review and approval process, which is an important part of OCC’s oversight of the CCDF program. OCC’s lack of established written policies limits its ability to ensure that staff follow appropriate protocols when implementing the State Plan review and approval process, and limits its ability to retain organizational knowledge in the event of staff turnover, which OCC noted as occurring during each review period. In addition, most of the State Plans submitted to OCC for the fiscal years 2019–2021 grant period did not contain information on the results of their states’ program-integrity activities. OCC also has not defined or communicated what it considers to be the “results” of program- integrity activities for states, which are requested to include this information in State Plans, or for its staff who will be responsible for analyzing this information. Until OCC defines its informational needs regarding program-integrity activity results and communicates this information to the states and its own staff, OCC may continue to lack quality information to help ensure states’ accountability of their program- integrity activities. Further, OCC does not have documented criteria to guide the review of the CAPs to ensure the proposed corrective actions are aimed at root causes of improper payments and are effectively implemented to prevent and reduce improper payments. Without criteria for its staff to use in reviewing the CAPs, OCC does not have assurance that the corrective actions a state proposes to reduce improper payments will be specifically aimed at root causes of improper payments and effectively implemented, leaving the CCDF program at continued risk of improper payments. OCC also does not have written policies for its CAP follow-up process or documentation that follow-up has been completed for past CAPs. In addition, OCC officials told us that they plan to develop a written protocol for this process, but did not specify a timeline for completion. Having established written policies for the CAP follow-up process will help ensure that OCC’s oversight and monitoring of CAPs is carried out consistently. OCC’s Monitoring System process does not currently contain criteria to assess the effectiveness of states’ program-integrity control activities, including fraud-fighting activities. Without developing and documenting criteria to assess whether states’ program-integrity control activities are effective, OCC cannot ensure that such program-integrity control activities are effective. In addition, OCC does not plan to collect any data from its technical-assistance tools that could potentially help it to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of states’ program-integrity activities. However, OCC has not evaluated the benefits of using these tools to collect information on program-integrity activities against any costs of doing so— such as the cost of seeking OMB approval to do so. By not evaluating the feasibility of collecting information from technical-assistance tools to monitor the effectiveness of states’ program-integrity control activities, OCC may be missing an opportunity to help states adapt control activities to improve their fraud risk management. All of the foregoing program-integrity oversight and monitoring activities could contribute to a strategy for managing fraud risks in the CCDF. However, OCC has not completed a fraud risk assessment or risk profile for the program. Although there is currently a process in place for ACF to develop a fraud risk assessment template, until ACF completes this template and carries out the assessment of the CCDF, it will lack a robust antifraud strategy and assurance that OCC’s current program-integrity activities are suitable and targeted at prioritized risk. We are making the following nine recommendations, eight to the Director of OCC and one to the Assistant Secretary for ACF: The Director of OCC should establish internal written policies to effectively implement and document the State Plan review and approval process for future review and approval periods. (Recommendation 1) The Director of OCC should define the informational needs related to the results of program-integrity activities. (Recommendation 2) The Director of OCC should communicate externally to the states its informational needs related to the results of states’ program-integrity activities. (Recommendation 3) The Director of OCC should communicate internally to staff its informational needs related to the results of states’ program-integrity activities. (Recommendation 4) The Director of OCC should develop documented criteria to guide the review of CAPs submitted by states to ensure that proposed corrective actions are aimed at root causes of improper payments and are effectively implemented. (Recommendation 5) The Director of OCC should timely complete its effort to develop established written policies for the CAP follow-up process to ensure that OCC’s oversight and monitoring of CAPs is carried out consistently. (Recommendation 6) The Director of OCC should develop and document criteria to assess the effectiveness of states’ program-integrity control activities. (Recommendation 7) The Director of OCC should evaluate the feasibility of collecting information from the Grantee Internal Controls Self-Assessment Instrument (Self-Assessment Instrument) and Fraud Toolkit, such as during its Monitoring System process, to monitor the effectiveness of states’ program-integrity control activities. (Recommendation 8) The Assistant Secretary for ACF should ensure that ACF conducts a fraud risk assessment to provide a basis for the documentation and development of an antifraud strategy that describes the CCDF program’s approach to address prioritizing fraud risks identified. (Recommendation 9) We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment. In its comments, reproduced in appendix I, HHS concurred with our recommendations. HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Secretary of Health and Human Services and appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staffs have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-6722 or bagdoyans@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix II. In addition to the contact named above, Jonathon Oldmixon (Assistant Director), Erica Varner (Analyst in Charge), Yue Pui Chin, and Daniel Dye made key contributions to this report. Other contributors include James Ashley, Maria McMullen, George Ogilvie, and Sabrina Streagle.\n","   9  According to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs report concerning PMIAA, the purpose of PMIAA is to improve program and project management in certain larger federal agencies. The act includes requirements for OMB, OPM, and the 24 agencies listed in the CFO Act. PMIAA requires OMB’s Deputy Director for Management or the designee to, among other things: adopt government-wide standards, policies, and guidelines for program and project management for executive agencies; engage with the private sector to identify best practices in program and project management that would improve federal program and project management; conduct portfolio reviews of agency programs not less than annually, to assess the quality and effectiveness of program management, in coordination with Program Management Improvement Officers (PMIO); establish a 5-year strategic plan for program and project conduct portfolio reviews of programs on our High-Risk List. The two types of portfolio reviews required by PMIAA—the portfolio reviews of agency programs and the portfolio reviews of programs identified as high risk on our High-Risk List—are separate requirements. For purposes of this report, we define programs, projects, and portfolios consistent with how those terms are defined in OMB’s PMIAA strategic plan. OMB defines program as the functions or activities which agencies are authorized and funded by statute to administer and enforce. Programs typically involve broad objectives. OMB views projects as temporary efforts with defined scopes to create products or services to improve the efficient and effective implementation of programs. Because programs are comprised of projects, programs inherently address the projects subsumed within them. Consequently, our discussions of programs throughout this report also pertain to projects. Finally, OMB defines portfolios as organized groupings of programs whose coordination in implementation enables agencies to achieve their objectives. The act also established the Program Management Policy Council (PMPC), an interagency forum for improving agency practices related to program management. OMB’s Deputy Director for Management chairs the PMPC. The PMPC responsibilities include advising OMB on the development and applicability of government-wide standards for program management transparency. Furthermore, the act requires PMPC members “to discuss topics of importance to the workforce,” such as workforce development needs and major challenges across agencies in managing programs. As chair of the PMPC, OMB’s Deputy Director is required to preside at meetings, determine agendas, direct the work, and establish and direct its subgroups, as appropriate. The act requires the PMPC to meet not less than twice per fiscal year. Additionally, OPM’s Director, in consultation with OMB’s Director, is required to issue regulations that: identify key skills and competencies needed for a program and a project manager in an agency; establish a new job series, or update and improve an existing job series, for program and project management within agencies; and establish a new career path for program and project managers within an agency. Overall, OPM’s role in implementing PMIAA is to establish a new job series or update an existing job series by providing the occupational standards that agencies will need to develop a trained and competent workforce with the program and project management experience, knowledge, and expertise to solve management challenges and support agency decision-making. The act requires OPM to establish new—or revise existing—occupational standards in consultation with OMB. Occupational standards are included within OPM’s classification guidance, which is provided to agencies to assist in classifying positions. This guidance helps agencies to determine the proper occupational series, position title, and grade of each position. The act requires OMB’s Deputy Director of Management to oversee implementation of the standards, policies, and guidelines for executive agencies. OMB implemented some PMIAA requirements using existing processes put in place to implement GPRAMA. We previously reported that GPRAMA provides important tools that can help decision makers address challenges facing the federal government, such as the annual reviews of progress on agency strategic objectives conducted during strategic reviews and the implementation of federal government priority goals. Federal government priority goals, also known as cross-agency priority (CAP) goals, are written by OMB in partnership with agencies. GPRAMA requires OMB to coordinate with agencies to develop CAP goals, which are 4-year outcome-oriented goals covering a number of complex or high-risk management and mission issues. For example, OMB directed agencies to align their noninformation technology major acquisition programs with relevant strategic objectives so they could assess progress for the PMIAA required program portfolio reviews concurrent with required GPRAMA strategic reviews. GPRAMA also requires OMB to present a program inventory of all federal programs by making information available about each federal program on a website. Finally, GPRAMA required OMB to establish a number of CAP goals intended to cover areas where increased cross-agency collaboration is needed to improve progress towards shared, complex policy or management objectives across the federal government. OMB uses CAP goals to address issues outlined in the President’s Management Agenda. For example, OMB wrote a CAP goal to improve management of major acquisitions across the government which complements PMIAA and its required activities. PMIAA requires the OMB Deputy Director, as chair of the PMPC, to conduct portfolio reviews of programs from our High-Risk List. The PMPC is also required to review programs we identify as high risk and to make recommendations for actions to be taken by the Deputy Director for Management of OMB or a designee. See figure 1 below for an overview of roles and responsibilities of OMB, OPM, the PMPC, and agencies. Agencies responsible for PMIAA implementation have taken steps to complete some requirements, but actions remain to fully implement the law (see Table 1). OMB met the PMIAA requirement “to establish a five-year strategic plan for program and project management.” The plan OMB developed details three key strategies to implement PMIAA: (1) coordinated governance, (2) regular OMB and agency engagement reviews, and (3) strengthening program management capacity to build a capable program management workforce. The three strategies focus on areas such as clarifying key roles and responsibilities, identifying principles-based standards, and identifying plans for enhancing workforce capabilities. The plan describes the roles and functions of the PMIOs, the PMPC, and the requirements of the agency implementation plans. It outlines a phased approach for implementing PMIAA actions with milestones occurring throughout the 5- year period. We found that OMB followed several strategic planning leading practices in the creation of the PMIAA strategic plan. First, the plan incorporates general goals and objectives for agencies’ implementation of PMIAA with three corresponding strategies explaining OMB’s overall approach. OMB followed a second leading practice by gathering input from stakeholders. OMB staff told us they solicited input from congressional staff, and members of external organizations like the Federal Program and Project Management Community of Practice (FedPM CoP). Agencies’ staff also confirmed to us that they had input into the OMB plan. Third, OMB demonstrated interagency collaboration in its efforts to establish and lead the PMPC and its efforts to work with the FedPM CoP to address any issues identified by agencies. Finally, the plan included a timeline with quarterly milestones to track completion of PMIAA’s activities and to gauge progress toward achieving the desired results of PMIAA. PMIAA required OMB to establish standards and policies for executive agencies consistent with widely accepted standards for program and project management planning and delivery. A consistent set of government-wide program management standards and policies is important because it helps ensure that agencies utilize key program management practices to improve the outcomes of government programs. OMB published in June 2018 a set of standards for program and project management as part of OMB’s PMIAA strategic plan. OMB’s strategic plan directed agencies to apply these 15 standards to internal management processes for planning, implementing, and reviewing the performance of programs and activities. OMB staff told us they decided to develop this set of standards rather than adopt an existing set of consensus-based standards, such as the widely accepted standards for program and project management from the Project Management Institute (PMI). PMI is a not-for-profit association that provides global standards for, among other things, project and program management. The PMI standards are utilized worldwide and provide guidance on how to manage various aspects of projects, programs, and portfolios and are approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). OMB staff told us that they decided not to specifically adopt the PMI standards because they wanted to allow agencies to use a range of standards that agencies had already developed and were using to manage their programs, such as standards developed in-house by NASA for their space flight programs. OMB further directed CFO Act agencies that the 15 standards and application of them should be incorporated or aligned with existing agency-specific program management policies and practices, and tailored to reflect program characteristics. OMB staff told us that they chose the approach to provide more principle-based standards, as opposed to specific standards, to be flexible enough for a range of government agencies to apply them. OMB’s standards are similar in definition to PMI standards, but they are less detailed by comparison. Our analysis of OMB’s standards shows that OMB uses similar definitions for all 10 of PMI’s program management standards and nine out of 10 of PMI’s project management standards, such as risk management and change management. However, OMB program and project management standards are less detailed when compared to PMI’s standards in the following ways: OMB standards do not provide a minimum threshold against which agencies can gauge to what extent they have met each standard. PMI’s Standard for Program Management provides the definition of a standard but also what components are required for an entity to confirm that the standard has been met. For example, meeting the program financial management standard in PMI requires a financial management plan to be developed, along with its related activities. This plan allows entities applying the standard to confirm whether they have met the standard for program financial management or not. OMB’s standards do not distinguish between how the standards apply differently to programs and projects while PMI has separate detailed standards for program management and for project management. The project management standards from PMI provide details on how the standards apply to more granular tasks, such as establishing a quality management or communication plan for a specific project. OMB’s standards do not distinguish between how the standards relate to each other during a program or project while PMI’s Standard for Program Management details how project standards help build on each other during a program. For example, a program scope management plan is needed to determine the type of schedule management planning that is necessary to accomplish the delivery of the program’s outputs and benefits. OMB provides minimal guidance on how standards apply differently across the life cycle of a program or project while PMI’s Standard for Program Management provides information detailing when a specific standard should be utilized in different ways during the life cycle of a program. For example, in the beginning of a program, risk management should be planned and an initial risk assessment created. Later, during program implementation, risk management tasks focus on monitoring, analyzing risk, and responding to risk. If the standards had the additional detail, it would be possible to determine if agencies are meeting them and properly applying them to programs and projects. Our work on the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) standards has emphasized the necessity for a governance structure with a clear set of policies and procedures for developing and maintaining standards over time that are consistent with leading practices. A governance structure is important because it helps ensure that the standards are developed, maintained, adjusted, and monitored over time. The DATA Act is similar to PMIAA because PMIAA gives OMB responsibility to develop standards for program management, and the DATA Act gives OMB and the Department of the Treasury responsibility for establishing data standards for the reporting of federal funds. These standards specify the data to be reported under the DATA Act and define and describe what is to be included in each element with the aim of ensuring that information will be consistent and comparable. Several governance models exist that could inform OMB’s efforts to help ensure that the standards are developed, maintained, adjusted, and monitored over time. These models define governance as an institutionalized system of decision rights and accountabilities for planning, overseeing, and managing standards. Many of these models promote having a common set of key practices that include establishing clear policies and procedures for developing, managing, and enforcing standards. A common set of key practices endorsed by standards setting organizations including the National Institute of Standards and Technology, ANSI, and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants recommend that governance structures should include the key practices shown in the text box below. Key Practices for Governance Structures 1. Delineating roles and responsibilities for decision-making and accountability, including roles and responsibilities for stakeholder input on key decisions. 2. Obtaining input from stakeholders and involving them in key decisions, as appropriate. 3. Developing and approving standards. 4. Making decisions about changes to existing standards and resolving conflicts related to the application of standards. 5. Managing, controlling, monitoring, and enforcing consistent application of standards. OMB staff told us they did not have any additional documentation about the governance structure used to develop the program management standards and how OMB will further develop and maintain them. We compared available information about OMB’s governance structure for developing and maintaining program management standards to the five key practices on governance structures and found OMB’s governance structure is incomplete in each of the five key practices. OMB has not delineated roles and responsibilities for decision-making and accountability, including responsibilities for stakeholder input on key decisions. OMB’s strategic plan notes that one role of the PMPC is to help further develop the program management standards. However, OMB has not provided information on how roles and responsibilities will be assigned to continue developing standards in the future. Without clearly delineated roles and responsibilities, there is a risk of confusion which could impede action and accountability for future improvements to program management standards. Further, having clearly delineated roles and responsibilities is particularly important during periods of transition when administrations change. OMB has an incomplete plan for how it will obtain input from stakeholders and involve them in decision-making. OMB received input from stakeholders on the standards it developed in 2018, though the strategic plan states that standards will be further developed with the PMPC in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. However, the strategic plan does not give details on how the PMPC and others will further develop standards. Without robust and comprehensive outreach to individuals who will use or otherwise be affected by the standards, the opportunity to learn from stakeholder experience and perspectives, or anyone who will use or otherwise be affected by the standards, may be diminished. OMB has an incomplete process for developing and approving program management standards. OMB developed and approved the existing standards by obtaining stakeholder input and releasing their approved standards in its strategic plan. However, the strategic plan does not provide documentation on how that process was structured and how it will function in the future. Thus, it is unclear how OMB plans to further develop the standards and what responsibilities and resources will be required from OMB, the PMPC, and agencies under the leadership of the agency PMIOs. OMB has not defined a process for making decisions about changes to existing standards and describing how conflicts related to the application of standards would be resolved. Therefore, it is unclear if or how the standards will be periodically reassessed and updated as circumstances change and leading practices in program and project management are identified. Also, lack of consensus on standards and conflict over how to use them can lead to weakened acceptance and inconsistent application. OMB has not defined a process for managing, controlling, monitoring, and enforcing consistent application of standards. OMB has not developed or directed any type of review or oversight process to determine the adequacy of existing or newly developed standards agency use to manage programs. Having such a process could help agencies to achieve a balance between consistent application of standards and flexible application to account for differences in programs, agency missions, and other factors. However, OMB staff told us that they consider the PMIAA program portfolio review process as a way to help monitor and enforce program standards, as they have a view into how each agency is applying standards for their particular portfolio of programs. Additionally, OMB has given agencies flexibility in using existing agency standards and flexibility to adopt or develop new ones. Without a review mechanism, OMB lacks reasonable assurance that agencies’ efforts to use existing standards or develop new ones will align with government-wide efforts to improve program and project management. Also, establishing an approach to monitoring agencies’ efforts would help identify opportunities to improve program management standards. Without having a governance structure for the program standards, the potential exists that standards will develop in an ad hoc manner, may be applied inconsistently or not at all, and may not be updated to reflect new developments in program management. Further, having a governance structure for managing efforts going forward better positions OMB to sustain progress on program standards as they change over time. PMIAA requires agencies and OMB to regularly review portfolios of programs to assess the quality and effectiveness of program management and identify opportunities for performance improvement. To conduct these portfolio reviews, OMB Circular A-11 notes that agencies and OMB are to use a set of broadly applicable program management principles, practices, and standards associated with successful program outcomes, in addition to more specific standards based on the type of program under review. As a way to help agencies acclimate to the requirements of PMIAA, OMB leveraged two components of the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA): the strategic review and a cross-agency priority (CAP) goal. OMB guidance stated that agencies’ portfolio reviews of programs would be conducted and integrated to the extent practical with strategic reviews. Furthermore, OMB staff told us that the implementation of PMIAA and the CAP goal for improving management of major acquisitions (CAP Goal 11) shared complementary goals and strategies. For example, the CAP Goal 11 action plan includes the routine monitoring of federal program management progress. Consequently, OMB staff said they decided that the first PMIAA program portfolio reviews would focus on major acquisitions. Excerpt from OMB Cross-agency Priority Goal 11 from 2018 President’s Management Agenda: Improve Management of Major Acquisitions Federal agencies will ensure that contracts supporting transformative and priority projects meet or beat delivery schedules, provide exceptional customer service, and achieve savings or cost avoidance for the taxpayer. The Challenge: Major acquisitions—which vary in size by agency but often exceed $50 million—account for approximately one-third of annual federal spend on contracts. These large contracts frequently support projects meant to transform areas of critical need. Yet major acquisitions often fail to achieve their goals because many federal managers lack the program management and acquisition skills required to successfully manage and integrate large and complex acquisitions into their projects. These short- comings are compounded by complex acquisition rules that reward compliance over creativity and results. The Strategies: Agencies will pursue three strategies: 1) strengthen program management capabilities in the acquisition workforce; 2) use modern and innovative acquisition flexibilities; and 3) track investments using portfolio, program, and project management principles. In 2018, OMB conducted a pilot project involving program portfolio review focused on noninformation technology (IT) major acquisition programs. According to OMB staff, the pilot project gave agencies the opportunity to complete “dry runs” for the PMIAA-required portfolio reviews and to provide lessons learned in anticipation of the fiscal year 2019 portfolio reviews. OMB planned for the results from the pilot to provide information for internal dialogue and decision-making about subsequent portfolio reviews. Further, according to OMB’s strategic plan, the purpose of the pilot was (1) to determine how well agency program portfolios of non-IT major acquisitions were performing throughout the life cycle of the investment using a set of standards and practices, and (2) to refine the process of coordinating program portfolio reviews as a component of OMB agency strategic reviews. For the pilot, OMB staff directed agencies to assess the cost, schedule, and performance of agency-selected acquisition portfolios. One result from the pilot was that agencies demonstrated a range of maturity in their abilities to collect data for these required program portfolio measures from their various departments and program types. OMB staff told us pilot agencies found it easier to compile data on major construction projects compared to service contracts. Consequently, an agency doing many of these projects might be more advanced than an agency for which major acquisitions focus on services. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) staff shared their lessons learned from their participation in pilot portfolio reviews, as seen in the text box below. OMB staff said that they determined that the portfolio review process worked sufficiently well for the pilot agencies and continued their planned strategy of focusing solely on non-IT major acquisition programs for fiscal year 2019 portfolio reviews. Example of Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Lessons Learned from Pilot Portfolio Review The VA looked at the effectiveness of portfolio management during the Office of Management and Budget noninformation technology major acquisition pilot portfolio review by focusing on the agency’s adherence to best practices in assessing project performance and progress. VA officials said this pilot informed their decision-making and was successful in the following ways: 1. The pilot helped VA determine logical ways to manage a portfolio by showing what data were helpful to make impactful decisions. 2. VA learned how best to display the data on cost, schedule, scope, and quality of outcomes on a dashboard to make it accessible and comparable across the agency. 3. VA learned that it needs to collect better quality data so that project management principles can be instituted and aligned across the agency. A well-developed and documented pilot program can help ensure that agency assessments produce information needed to make effective program and policy decisions. Such a process enhances the quality, credibility, and usefulness of evaluations in addition to helping to ensure the effective use of time and resources. We have identified five leading practices that, taken together, form a framework for effective pilot design, as seen in the text box below. OMB fulfilled the first leading practice of establishing objectives in its design of the PMIAA pilot program portfolio review. OMB’s PMIAA strategic plan and the CAP Goal 11 Action Plan stated the objectives of the pilot. In addition to the two objectives listed in the PMIAA strategic plan, the CAP Goal 11 Action Plan lists seven pilot objectives, as seen in the text box below. PMIAA Pilot Program Portfolio Review Objectives 1. Perform portfolio management preparation activities 2. Identify first portfolio of major acquisitions 3. Align portfolio with agency strategic goals 4. Collect performance data for each item in the portfolio 5. OMB officials said that they did not structure the pilot to follow the remaining four leading practices for effective pilot design. However, OMB said that it learned that the pilot agencies demonstrated several program management capabilities. They also learned that it would be important to tailor portfolio reviews to the agency and the program to account for significant differences in the types of acquisitions and the level of program management maturity. Despite identifying lessons learned from its pilot program portfolio review, in neglecting to fully follow leading practices, OMB may have missed opportunities to make additional improvements for fiscal year 2019 portfolio reviews. Going forward, as OMB expands the portfolio reviews to other types of program areas beyond non-IT major acquisitions, it has the opportunity to develop and learn from additional pilots. Although OMB staff have not yet determined if they will do additional pilots for program management in the future, they could decide to pilot the portfolio reviews of grants that they plan to initiate in fiscal year 2020. For fiscal year 2019, OMB directed all agencies to select portfolios of non-IT acquisition programs and align them with relevant strategic objectives as part of their internal agency strategic review processes. In spring 2019, OMB expected agencies to discuss one to two of these major-acquisition portfolio reviews during their strategic reviews with OMB. OMB expected agencies to track the cost, schedule, and performance of their selected major acquisition programs. However, OMB reports that not all agency program portfolio reviews were completed because OMB was behind in scheduling the reviews due to the partial government shutdown. According to documents we reviewed and what OMB staff told us, in October 2019 OMB completed agency program portfolio reviews with ten agencies: the Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Transportation; the General Services Administration, the Social Security Administration, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the US Agency for International Development. OMB staff also told us that they also held preparatory meetings with agencies to set expectations for future portfolio reviews. OMB reported that these one-on-one meetings were held with 12 agencies as of October 2019 to discuss their initial portfolio structures and other transformative initiatives. Portfolio reviews in 2020 are to expand in scope to include grants, and also will continue acquisition portfolio reviews as part of the agency’s routine management processes. However, OMB has not yet identified other program areas, such as research and development or benefit programs, to be included in future portfolio reviews. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that effective information and communication are vital for an entity to achieve its objectives. Specifically, management should externally communicate necessary quality information to achieve its objectives. Increasing communication to agencies about specific program areas, portfolio review procedures, and expectations beyond 2020 could help ensure continued progress to implement PMIAA more broadly. Furthermore, communicating such procedures with specific time frames could help agencies better direct their efforts to improve the portfolio review processes. GPRAMA requires OMB to make a list of all federal programs identified by agencies publicly available, on a central government-wide website. The implementation of the program inventory is a critical tool to help decision makers better identify and manage programs across the federal government. Among other things, the completion of the program inventory would provide agencies and Congress with a comprehensive list of programs, so it would be clear how many programs agencies are managing and how they relate to their strategic objectives and portfolios of programs at each agency. Having a program inventory could also help ensure a match between the number of agency programs and needed program manager resources. Agencies continue to struggle with challenges defining their programs. Officials from three of the five selected agencies we spoke with told us that they have not yet identified all of their programs and projects. In our first report on the program inventory in October 2014, we noted similar issues. For example, agencies were not using the same program definition approach across their subcomponents or offices, which limited comparability of their own programs. We made eight recommendations in that report to the Director of OMB to update relevant guidance to help develop a more coherent picture of all federal programs and to better ensure information is useful for decision makers. As of October 2019, OMB had not taken any actions in response to the eight recommendations. While OMB has provided a timetable for action in its June 2019 A-11 guidance, this does not complete the recommendation. In September 2017, we made two recommendations to OMB to make progress on the federal program inventory. First, we recommended that OMB consider using a systematic approach for the program inventory, such as the one we developed from principles of information architecture. Information architecture—a discipline focused on organizing and structuring information—offers an approach for developing a program inventory to support a variety of uses, including increased transparency for federal programs. OMB staff told us that they considered our information architecture approach and noted that a structured information architecture format is used on USASpending.gov. However, OMB staff told us they had not yet determined how the information architecture format of USASpending.gov—which is focused on spending data—could be used to meet additional information reporting requirements and our past recommendations related to the inventory. We made a second recommendation that OMB should revise and publicly issue OMB guidance—through an update to its Circular A-11, a memorandum, or other means—to provide time frames and associated milestones for implementing the federal program inventory. As mentioned above, OMB did provide a timetable but it does not have milestones. According to the timetable, beginning with the 2021 budget cycle, agencies’ program activities will be used for the inventory’s program-level reporting requirements. This will allow OMB and agencies to present program-level spending data by leveraging what is reported on USASpending.gov as required by the DATA Act. However, OMB’s guidance does not cover other inventory information reporting requirements, or the actions we recommended in October 2014. We will continue to monitor progress. We continue to believe it is important for OMB to implement our program inventory recommendations. Such an inventory could be a critical tool to help decision makers better identify and manage fragmentation, overlap, and duplication across the federal government. Additionally, fully taking action on these recommendations would assist agencies in identifying programs, better prepare for future PMIAA portfolio reviews, and help match resources to agencies’ program management needs. Further, OMB developed three different definitions for what constitutes a “program” or “program activity” that it provided to agencies in its PMIAA, GPRAMA, and DATA Act guidance, respectively. OMB developed each of these definitions independently and in response to three different statutory requirements. OMB staff told us that these three requirements differ in their legislative intent. The definitions and their associated guidance are in the table below. OMB has not reconciled these overlapping, yet divergent, definitions of what constitutes a “program” or “program activity.” According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, management should ensure that specific terms are fully and clearly set forth so they can be easily understood. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government also states that management should design processes that use entities’ objectives and related risks to identify information requirements needed to achieve objectives and address risks. OMB has defined what constitutes a “program” or “program activity” in PMIAA, GPRAMA, and the DATA Act each, but its three different program definitions and approaches to determining what is a “program,” could cause confusion for agencies. Agency officials from the Department of Energy told us they are already experiencing confusion over how to appropriately apply the applicable program definition to identify their programs for PMIAA. Agency officials from Treasury told us that different definitions for programs could contribute to confusion as they work to implement PMIAA within the Department. The inconsistent approaches may increase the burden on agencies as they work to identify, maintain, and report on three sets of differently defined programs. Conversely, clarifying the definitions could help agencies and OMB identify synergies across the three laws and increase transparency. For example, providing explanations of how the term “program” or “program activity” is used across the three statutory definitions and developing a crosswalk to show similarities and differences could provide more clarity for agencies. Then, spending and performance data can be aligned with agency strategic goals, which could be monitored, reviewed, and reported in a streamlined manner. OPM followed PMIAA requirements to create policy and guidance. Specifically, according to documents we reviewed, OPM (1) worked with subject matter experts to develop program and project management skills and competencies, (2) updated the program management 0340 job series and created guidance for identifying project management positions, (3) plans to release a career path for program and project managers by the end of calendar year 2019, and (4) plans to create a unique job identifier code that can be used to pinpoint program and project managers in any job series. These efforts will form the foundation needed by agencies to strengthen resource and talent management. Competency modeling. Since enactment of PMIAA, OPM identified skills and competencies which will be required for program and project managers. According to documents we reviewed, OPM met with subject matter experts and human capital staff in agencies to help identify the skills needed to develop the competency model. OPM also conducted a literature review looking at prior competency studies and industry practices to help identify and support program and project management competencies. OPM also drew from Project Management Institute resources, such as the Project Management Body of Knowledge and the Standard for Program Management, as part of identifying its competencies. The resulting competencies are in two categories: general and technical. General competencies focus on interpersonal or general on-the-job skills such as teamwork and problem solving. Technical competencies more narrowly focus on particular skills needed to run programs and projects, such as risk management and cost-benefit analysis. OPM documents stated that agencies will need to determine the applicability of these competencies to positions within their agency. Agencies must determine if staff meet the competencies, and if not, staff will have the opportunity to develop them or must move to a different job series, according to OPM staff. OPM staff also said additional competency assessment steps are needed to finalize the model. Agencies will be given time to consider the competency model. In addition, OPM will use subject matter expert panels to further develop the model, according to OPM documents we reviewed. Updated job series. To implement job series requirements in PMIAA, OPM staff conducted an occupational study and determined that pre- existing classification policy was sufficient for classifying program management work rather than creating a new job series classifying program management positions, according to OPM staff. Prior to OPM updating the program management 0340 job series for PMIAA, the classification standard was not developed, as it did not contain competencies describing what qualifications staff were required to meet as a program manager. In May 2019, OPM released the updated job series classification guidance designed to assist agencies in determining which employees fit in the job series. OPM also released guidance for classifying project managers to help agencies specifically identify project managers in any occupational job series. According to the memorandum sent by the Acting Director of OPM to agencies with the OPM classification guidance, agencies are required to implement the policy and guidance to covered positions by May 1, 2020. Career path. OPM staff told us that they have developed a career path for program and project managers that is currently in internal review. They said that the value of the updated career path is that it will highlight training and skills needed to progress in a program management career. According to the presentation given by OPM at the 2019 April PMPC meeting, the career path will contain: (1) a career progression outline for employees to move among and across jobs in program and project management, (2) help for employees and supervisors to plan and sequence appropriate career training and development for each general and technical competency, and (3) a list of common degrees and certifications completed by program and project managers, among other things. Staff told us they plan to release the program and project management career path for agency comment by the end of calendar year 2019. Job identifier for program managers and project managers. Because program and project managers are found in other job series outside the 0340 program management series, OPM is developing a job identifier code that can be attached to any job series for the purposes of identifying program and project managers. OPM staff told us that program managers classified to the 0340 series means that the position does not have a specialization. If the position requires specialized expertise, the position would be classified to a specialized occupational series but would also have a program management job identifier code. For example, since a grants managers is also a program manager, “grants manager (program management)” would be his or her official title. Project management positions will also use a job identifier to identify project managers in any occupational series. The job identifier will allow employees with a specialization to be designated program and project managers, while still maintaining their original career path. OPM staff told us they plan to complete this project in 2020. Our analysis of OPM Enterprise Human Resources Integration data shows that the 0340 job series included about 15,000 employees across all 24 CFO Act agencies in fiscal year 2018. However, OPM reported that not all employees in this job series are actually program and project managers; conversely, many program and project managers are working outside of the 0340 job series. Selected agencies reported varying degrees of difficulty identifying program and project managers. For example, NASA staff reported that they were able to identify almost all their program and project managers. In contrast, the Department of the Treasury reported that it faces challenges identifying the number of program and project managers outside of the program management job series, as this would require a resource-intensive manual effort, made more challenging by the agency’s large, complex, and decentralized structure. The Department of Energy (DOE) staff said they have not completed the count of their program managers. The Departments of Commerce and Veterans Affairs also report they do not know the number of program and project managers in their departments, respectively. The Department of Commerce staff told us that they cannot accurately identify the number of program and project managers until they can use the job identifier that they expect OPM to release in 2020. Further, Commerce officials told us they are also continuing to work to identify program managers and engaged the Project Management Institute (PMI) to request a list of those within Commerce who have the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. PMI was able to provide Commerce details about the numbers of PMPs at Commerce, but PMI declined to share the names of those individuals with the PMP certification. In OPM’s 2018 Federal Workforce Priorities report, OPM recognizes that not all agencies have adequately analyzed workload demands, staffing levels, or current and future skills needs—all steps in workforce planning. As part of the OPM human capital framework, agencies are required to develop a human capital operating plan which is an agency’s human capital implementation document. These plans are to describe how agencies will execute the human capital strategies needed to implement the agency’s strategic plan and Annual Performance Plan (APP). Agencies are also required to include program specific strategies (e.g., hiring, closing skills gaps, etc.) in the APPs as appropriate. Effective workforce planning can help agencies focus on determining how many program and project managers they have, how many they may need, what skills gaps exist, and what training and other strategies can help address skills gaps. OPM’s workforce planning model is comprised of five steps: 1. Set strategic direction; 2. Analyze workforce, identify skills gaps, and conduct workforce 3. Develop action plan; 4. Implement action plans; and 5. Monitor, evaluate, and revise. The discussion below describes how OPM and agencies are working to strengthen the program management workforce in the context of OPM’s workforce planning model. Some activities may span more than one phase of workforce planning. Set strategic direction. The PMIAA strategic plan establishes direction for agencies to build its program management capacity and capability with its third strategy, “Strengthening Program Management Capacity to Build a Capable Program Management Workforce.” Setting strategic direction also involves linking work activities to the objectives of a strategic plan. OPM’s planned activities, such as updating the classification standards and creating a job identifier, are critical to executing this strategy so agencies can identify their workforce and build program management capacity through training, career paths, and mentorship opportunities. Analyze workforce, identify skills gaps, and conduct workforce analysis. OPM and agencies are in the early stages of identifying who their program and project managers are and what human capital strategies might be needed to address agencies’ needs. Documents we reviewed showed that OPM also worked with the Chief Human Capital Officers Council, the Chief Administrative Officers Council and others to develop competencies. These competencies provide a foundation for the subsequent assessment of program and project manager skills. Develop action plan. In their PMIAA implementation plans, some agencies have identified available training and possible recruitment and hiring strategies. In OPM’s model, agencies need to complete their workforce analysis before they can develop their action plans. Implement plan. This step is dependent on agencies developing action plans. However, OPM and agencies have already started to develop staff in the absence of plans. For example, OPM is working with agencies to identify program management training matching desired competencies to be placed in an online training repository that will be accessible to all agencies. OPM staff told us that agencies would provide the trainings from their learning management systems and offer them for interagency access. OPM is developing this training and development repository which will house agency-owned courses and also identify mentors in project and program management, according to OPM staff. OPM will house the repository on its training and development policy wiki at https://www.opm.gov/wiki/training/index.aspx. Each PMIO is to also establish a website with agency-specific program management tools and resources. Additionally, OMB recognized that the Federal Program and Project Management Community of Practice (FedPM CoP), scaled up from a community of practice housed in DOE, could be an important partner in supporting PMIAA implementation. As of April 2019, more than 1,000 managers had joined the FedPM CoP as indicated in its briefing to the PMPC. The FedPM CoP has identified several project management-related documents that are now available on the PMIAA portal. To further develop program managers, OMB is working with agencies to improve mentoring and recognition efforts. To improve mentoring government-wide, OMB reports that PMIOs will work with agency chief human capital offices to develop and implement a mentoring strategy for agency program managers. OMB also plans to take existing mentorship programs established in more functionally aligned-management fields (e.g., information technology, acquisition) and expand them to include a broader range of management career paths. To improve recognition efforts in acquisitions, the Chief Acquisition Officer Council plans to establish an annual award to recognize federal program manager excellence. Monitor, evaluate, and revise. This step cannot begin until agencies develop and implement their workforce action plans. As agencies begin to monitor their implementation of these plans, they will need to determine if any skills gaps exist in the program and project manager occupational series. OPM regulations require agencies to describe in their human capital operating plans agency-specific skills and competency gaps that must be closed through the use of agency selected human capital strategies. Agencies must also have policies and programs that monitor and address skills gaps within government wide and agency-specific mission-critical occupations. OPM has not yet determined if program and project management occupations are experiencing mission-critical skills gaps across the government, and OPM staff noted that agencies are not specifically required to report program and project manager skills gaps in their annual human capital operating plans. OMB and OPM both missed statutory deadlines to fulfill requirements in PMIAA. In June 2018, OMB issued the required PMIAA agency implementation guidance in the PMIAA strategic plan, 6 months after the statutory deadline of December 2017. According to OMB staff, this delay was due to their own research project to (1) build sufficient knowledge in program and project management; and (2) increase stakeholder support in Congress and with agencies for its approach. Specifically, OMB met with experts from PMI, academics, consulting firms, federal chief senior level officer (CXO) councils, and other agency officials to increase its own understanding of program and project management principles. OMB staff told us that they used the collected information to draft initial guidance, which they then shared with congressional stakeholders and executive branch agency officials to obtain feedback and incorporate changes. OMB staff also told us that it was a transition year from one administration to another administration, and this transition was an additional factor in delaying completion of the guidance. None of the selected agencies’ staff identified an impact from the delayed guidance. OPM officials told us they missed the statutory deadline to complete their required activities after the issuance of OMB guidance. The release of the policy and guidance was due to the partial government shutdown from December 22, 2018 to January 25, 2019, along with a 3-month delay due to OPM’s own internal review and clearance process. As a result, OPM released the key skills and competencies needed for program and project management on April 5, 2019, and the classification guidance for the program manager job series 0340 and project manager interpretative guidance on May 2, 2019. OPM officials told us that agencies have 1 year from the date of issuance to comment on any language in the guidance. None of the selected agencies’ staff identified an impact from OPM’s delays, although one agency expressed concern that the pace of their efforts to identify program and project managers is dependent on OPM completing the job identifier. Figure 2 shows the delays in releasing OMB and OPM guidance. OMB officials established the PMPC in 2018 and fulfilled requirements that it meet at least twice per year. By September 2018, the 24 CFO Act agencies had all appointed a PMIO and held three PMPC meetings, in September 2018, April 2019, and September 2019. Selected agenda items for these PMPC meetings included: status updates on OPM completing program and project manager competencies, job series, and career path; breakout sessions to discuss PMIAA implementation approaches with discussion of PMPC priorities and focus for 2020. At the April 2019 PMPC meeting, for example, staff from the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Science Foundation shared some best practices, such as how to improve the tracking performance of portfolios, programs, and projects. According to OMB documents we reviewed, OMB plans to: convene the PMPC in the first quarter of each calendar year to prepare for upcoming OMB and agency strategic review meetings; use the PMPC meeting in the third quarter of the calendar year to review findings and outcomes from the most recent strategic review; update program and project management standards based on its findings and feedback at the PMPC meeting in the fourth quarter of 2020; use the PMPC to develop revised strategies, initiatives, and priorities to be reflected in an updated 5-year strategic plan at the PMPC meeting in the fourth quarter of 2021; and use the PMPC to focus on improving our high-risk areas at some future point. At the September 2019 PMPC meeting, OMB informed agencies of PMIAA implementation resources placed on OMB’s online portal for PMIAA and discussed OMB’s observations on portfolio reviews completed in 2019. One observation was the need to reinforce better visualization of performance data. In addition, OPM updated the PMPC on the status of its required PMIAA workforce efforts. The PMPC decided its primary focus for the year 2020 should be on the third strategy of the PMIAA strategic plan to build a capable workforce. Officials from the selected agencies that we interviewed provided us some suggestions on how OMB can improve the functionality of the PMPC. Table 3 illustrates the range of these suggestions: The PMPC met twice in 2019, as required by PMIAA, and has not established any working groups to help execute its significant responsibilities to share leading practices, develop standards, and help improve the workforce. Agencies have taken initial steps to incorporate requirements into program efforts. According to OMB guidance, agencies were to report in implementation plans how they are institutionalizing PMIAA efforts— especially PMIO responsibilities—into existing program and project management practices. OMB requested that agencies include 10 specific elements in their implementation plans, such as: identification of the agency PMIO, identification of major acquisition portfolios, and strategies and actions for enhancing training and improving recruitment and retention of program and project managers. These plans were due to OMB by November 30, 2018. We reviewed PMIAA draft implementation plans for 22 of the 24 CFO Act agencies and determined the extent to which agencies included the required elements in their plans. In its PMPC meeting in April 2019, OMB reported that a majority of agencies only partially included OMB requirements in their draft implementation plans. OMB told us they have not directed agencies to address missing requirements nor have they required agencies to finalize their draft implementation plans. They told us that they view the implementation plans as an opportunity for each agency to engage with OMB and discuss how they will implement PMIAA. OMB staff told us that their view is that if implementation plans provide value to agencies, they may stay in draft form and do not need to be final. Overall, draft implementation plans for these agencies provided some but not all information required to fully meet the directives from OMB. Our analysis of the plans shows that on average, agencies fully met six out of 10 requirements for their implementation plans. For example, almost all agencies met the requirements for identifying the PMIO (21 out of 22). However, 11 out of 22 agencies did not provide complete information on major acquisition portfolios. Table 4 shows how agencies’ implementation plans varied in meeting the requirements. Seven of 24 agencies reported in our questionnaire that they were creating either task forces or new or restructured offices to direct PMIAA implementation within their agencies. For example, DOE reported establishing a new office to support its PMIO. The Department of the Treasury and NASA reported creating an intra-agency cross-functional core team to discuss and design PMIAA implementation strategies. OPM reported establishing an enterprise program management office to drive the standardization of program and project management processes internally. Agencies selected PMIOs in existing leadership positions to leverage resources and agency processes to implement PMIAA. All agency PMIOs reported having additional leadership responsibilities beyond their PMIO roles. OMB documentation and information gathered from CFO Act agencies shows: every PMIO has at least one additional CXO role within its agency; thirty-eight percent of PMIOs have an additional performance management role; eight of 24 PMIOs have an additional budgetary role; and four of the 24 PMIOs have an explicit additional program or acquisition role. In the past, we have met with senior management officials from OMB and applicable agencies to discuss where additional management attention could be beneficial to addressing high-risk areas identified on our High- Risk List. We also reported that these trilateral meetings, which began in 2007 and pre-dated PMIAA’s 2016 enactment, have continued across administrations and have been critical for progress that has been made in addressing high-risk areas. According to PMIAA, OMB’s Deputy Director of Management is to conduct annual portfolio reviews of the most at-risk agency programs, as designated by our High-Risk List. OMB officials view the trilateral meetings as their method for holding the portfolio review meetings for high-risk areas as required under PMIAA. Our High-Risk List is comprised of programs as well as functions and operations. Consequently, in our assessment of OMB’s implementation of PMIAA, we consider programs, functions, and operations on our High-Risk List as relevant for OMB’s portfolio review of areas on our High-Risk List. OMB used three strategies intended to meet PMIAA’s high-risk requirements. OMB (1) expanded its strategic reviews in 2018 to include a review of some high-risk areas, (2) continued to use the long-standing trilateral meetings to review high-risk areas with agency leaders and with us, and (3) held ad hoc meetings with agencies outside of the strategic review and trilateral meetings. In preparation for the 2018 strategic reviews, OMB issued Memorandum M-18-15 directing agencies to provide several items in advance of their strategic review meetings with OMB. Requested items included updates from agencies on areas identified on our High-Risk List in which agencies disagreed with our recommendations or faced implementation barriers preventing progress. These materials were to be discussed during strategic review meetings. Thirteen CFO Act agencies reported submitting high-risk updates to OMB prior to these meetings, and eight agencies reported discussing their high-risk areas with OMB during the meetings. OMB guidance from June 2019, communicated in OMB’s Circular No. A- 11, did not include the statement from Memorandum M-18-15 that high- risk areas would be discussed during strategic review meetings. OMB staff felt that a broader approach could yield better results for addressing high-risk areas. Guidance in Circular No. A-11 maintained that agencies should submit updates about high-risk programs to OMB for the Deputy Director’s high-risk portfolio review, but it did not specify what should comprise agency updates about high-risk programs. Also, OMB staff told us that they requested that agencies provide topics for discussion at strategic review meetings, and that agencies could provide agenda items related to our High-Risk List. OMB staff said they addressed only a few of the high-risk issues during strategic reviews, both during the review process and the strategic review meetings. Discussions about high-risk issues during strategic review meetings generally focused on government-wide high-risk areas, if relevant, such as “Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation” and “Improving the Management of Information Technology (IT) Acquisitions and Operations.” However, OMB and agencies also discussed high-risk areas in instances when agencies provided strategic review meeting agenda topics related to our High-Risk List. For example, Treasury staff told us they spoke with OMB this year about high-risk areas as part of the strategic review process. Treasury is directly responsible for the Enforcement of Tax Laws high-risk area and shares responsibility with other agencies for other high-risk areas, such as the government-wide areas on cybersecurity and strategic human capital. OMB has held a limited number of trilateral meetings with agencies and us about high-risk areas as part of the high-risk portfolio reviews. Between March 2018 and October 2019, OMB addressed the following five high-risk areas in trilateral meetings with applicable agencies and us: 2020 Decennial Census, Managing Federal Real Property, Government-wide Personnel Security Clearance Process, Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation, and NASA Acquisition Management. OMB has not held meetings to address the remaining 30 high-risk areas on our High-Risk List. OMB staff told us they plan to hold additional meetings in the next year but that they are unlikely to be able to schedule all remaining meetings within our 2-year cycle for updating the High-Risk List. OMB staff said that it is sometimes challenging to coordinate and convene trilateral meetings given the high-ranking officials who must attend and finding available times across schedules. OMB also told us that they plan to meet with agencies for all high-risk areas eventually, but that they prioritize meetings aligned with our priority areas and the President’s Management Agenda. We evaluate progress made on high-risk areas every 2 years to determine if new areas should be added to our High-Risk List and if areas on the list should be removed due to progress to address the risks. Top leadership commitment is one of the five criteria we use to assess whether progress is being made to address and ultimately remove areas from our high-risk list. As we have reported in our March 2019 High-Risk Series report, leadership commitment is the critical element for initiating and sustaining progress, and leaders provide needed support and accountability for managing risks. Leadership commitment is vital if agencies are to adequately address high-risk areas, and trilateral meetings have been critical in focusing leadership attention in the past. Because OMB officials have met on only five of 35 high-risk areas, it remains to be seen if they will meet on all high-risk areas in the future. Convening the trilateral meetings on all high-risk areas in the 2-year reporting cycle, would better position OMB to enhance the leadership commitment needed to make greater progress on the remaining high-risk areas. Staff from OMB said that they sometimes have briefings related to agencies’ high-risk areas separate from the annual strategic review meetings and high-risk trilateral meetings. These meetings happen on an ad hoc basis and are typically initiated by agency officials. Officials from some of our selected agencies corroborated that the discussion at the strategic review meetings and trilateral meetings is not the full extent of OMB’s interaction with agencies about high-risk areas throughout the year. For example, VA officials said that high-risk areas are frequently agenda items in meetings with OMB. NASA officials said they spoke with OMB about NASA’s high-risk areas after submitting material as part of the strategic review process. The PMPC, chaired by the Deputy Director for Management of OMB, did not address our High-Risk List during its three meetings nor did it make recommendations to OMB about addressing high-risk areas, as required. The PMPC meetings have lasted 60 to 90 minutes each and the High-Risk List has not appeared as an item on any of the PMPC meeting agendas. OMB staff said PMPC meetings at this point in PMIAA implementation primarily act as forums in which agencies can share program management practices. Rather than focusing meeting time on high-risk areas, OMB staff asserted that the best use of the PMPC is primarily as a forum for agencies to share program and project management best practices. Consequently, the PMPC has not satisfied all PMPC requirements as delineated in PMIAA, including for high-risk areas to be addressed. OMB created a dashboard to identify measures of cost, schedule, and performance that agencies should use to track their selected non-IT major acquisition programs for the first PMIAA program portfolio review. OMB partnered with the General Services Administration to complete a prototype of a dashboard to show cost, schedule, and performance data from each program or project within a portfolio of programs. The dashboard also provides a short description of each program or project and its strategic alignment to the agency’s relevant strategic goal. Staff from OMB’s Office of Federal Procurement Policy said the dashboard could provide them with some visibility and improved transparency for major acquisitions programs. According to the PMIAA strategic plan, the dashboard would display the agency portfolio and summarize performance for each item in the portfolio, similar to the portfolio reviews of IT programs required by the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act. Initially, according to OMB, it plans to request summary information for each portfolio, and restrict the dashboard to authorized government employees. Moving forward, OMB staff said that as the portfolio management process matures, a portion of the dashboard may be available to the public, similar to the IT dashboard. OMB staff told us they are in conversation with agencies about how to overcome difficulties in collecting data for the dashboard. According to OMB, the results from the pilot portfolio review showed that agencies experienced challenges with collecting high-quality data. OMB staff said there will likely be more metrics for large construction projects because management practices for them are more mature than for other types of programs, such as services. OMB is working with agencies to see how they can retrieve cost, schedule, and performance data that could provide early warning indicators of potential problems with programs. Agencies reported in our questionnaire they are considering various ways to measure implementation of PMIAA. A little more than half of agencies responding to our PMIAA questionnaire provided ideas on how to measure implementation of PMIAA, such as tracking completion of their identified PMIAA milestones, developing their own survey as a baseline measure, or using their agency implementation plan outcomes to measure results. Six agencies’ questionnaire responses noted that they are planning to use existing metrics to assess program performance, either through internal processes or their annual strategic review process. For example, Treasury plans to focus in the near term on tracking completion of milestones of PMIAA implementation, such as major program and project alignment to department strategic objectives, development of an information-sharing site for program and project management resources, and workforce capabilities, among other things. VA anticipates developing outcome measures associated with successful program execution and is leveraging measures from existing plans, such as their Acquisition Human Capital Plan. OMB staff told us that they have no plans to identify measures to assess outcomes of PMIAA because it is too early and agencies are in the early stages of implementation. Rather than tracking anything specific, they told us that OMB looks at whether agencies’ PMIOs are engaged, if agencies are using training material and mentorship programs, the involvement of chief senior level officers, and if there is funding in the budget for program management certificate programs. However, OMB has not identified specific measures to track any of these areas. In collaboration with OMB, VA developed a program management maturity model survey identify capability gaps, obtain insights, and enable benchmarking of program management capabilities. It surveyed agencies’ level of maturity on a range of program management capabilities, such as talent management, governance, and portfolio management. Maturity assessment surveys can be useful tools for measuring progress to develop capacity in areas such as program management, according to subject matter specialists. Periodically measuring maturity can help agencies institutionalize continuous assessment and improvement. PMI also supports using such tools to identify trends that can help pinpoint actions needed and opportunities to learn from more mature organizations. We have found that ongoing performance measurement can serve as an early warning system to management and as a vehicle for improving accountability to the public. We have previously reported that providing baseline and trend data can help to assess an agency’s performance more fully because the data show progress over time and decision makers can use historical data to assess performance. As OMB and agencies move forward with PMIAA implementation, it will be critical to measure how agencies are maturing or building their capacity in the areas of program and project management. Such measures could include showing how OMB’s program management standards and principles are integrated into agencies’ programs and policies, the improvement of data quality used to track agency program outcomes in the program portfolio reviews, and improvement in program manager skills. Although not required by PMIAA, it is a good practice for OMB and agencies to consider ways to measure the effects of the act. Without establishing such measures to assess PMIAA outcomes, it will be challenging to gauge how agencies are making progress to identify trends, or to help agencies improve data quality. The program and project management standards OMB developed are less detailed than accepted standards and are missing several elements that would have made them more useful. For example, the OMB standards do not provide a minimum threshold against which agencies can gauge to what extent they have met each standard. Further, OMB’s current governance structure is insufficient for further developing and maintaining program management standards. Although OMB received input from stakeholders to develop the standards and plans to update them in partnership with the PMPC in 2020, OMB does not have a governance structure that assigns roles and responsibilities to further develop, approve, maintain, or monitor standards. Having such a governance structure for managing efforts going forward could help sustain the program standards as they change over time. OMB did not follow most leading practices for designing pilots and may have missed opportunities to make improvements for fiscal year 2019 portfolio reviews. OMB has not determined if it plans to conduct additional pilot efforts. Going forward, as OMB expands the portfolio reviews to other types of program areas beyond non-IT major acquisitions, it has the opportunity to develop and learn from additional pilots. Although OMB staff have not yet determined if they will do additional pilots for program management in the future, they could decide to pilot the portfolio reviews of grants that they plan to initiate in fiscal year 2020. OMB has not identified other program areas beyond non-IT major acquisitions and grants to be included in future portfolio reviews. Communicating to agencies about specific program areas, portfolio review procedures, time frames, and expectations beyond 2020 could help agencies better direct their efforts to improve the portfolio review processes and help ensure continued progress to implement PMIAA more broadly. As of October 2019, OMB had not taken any actions in response to the recommendations in our September 2017 report and has not yet fully established an inventory of federal programs. Such an inventory of programs could be a critical tool to help agency officials identify and manage programs across the federal government. Furthermore, if OMB were to fully implement our recommendations and complete the required inventory of federal programs, it would assist agencies to match resources to agencies’ program management needs and assist agencies in preparing for future PMIAA portfolio reviews. Furthermore, OMB provides three different definitions for a “program” in its guidance for PMIAA, GPRAMA, and the DATA Act. Having different definitions of what constitutes a program could lead to confusion among agencies. It could also cause increased burden on agencies as they work to identify, maintain, and report on three sets of differently defined programs. Meetings between OMB, relevant agencies, and us have been critical for past progress on high-risk areas. However, OMB has held these trilateral meetings to address only five of 35 high-risk areas since it began implementing PMIAA. These meetings could both demonstrate and improve the commitment of agency leadership to high-risk areas across the federal government. As we have reported, leadership commitment is a key tenet in agencies’ ability to address high-risk areas. Without convening trilateral meetings on each high-risk area, OMB might miss opportunities to make progress toward addressing high-risk areas by improving leadership commitment to addressing them. The PMPC did not address our High-Risk List during its meetings nor has it made recommendations to OMB about high-risk areas. The High-Risk List has not appeared as an item on any of the PMPC meeting agendas. OMB staff asserted that the best use of the PMPC’s limited meeting time is as a forum for agencies to share program management best practices. In choosing to focus on program management practices rather than high- risk areas, the PMPC has not satisfied all PMPC requirements as delineated in PMIAA. Having measures to assess outcomes of PMIAA, such as establishing a baseline of information on programs or collecting trend data, can help OMB ensure that it has established a framework to effectively guide and assess PMIAA’s implementation. Assessment measures would also allow OMB to better target efforts to improve project management and the capabilities of managers. We are making a total of eight recommendations to OMB. Specifically: The Deputy Director for Management of OMB, in conjunction with the PMPC, should develop program and project management standards to include (1) a minimum threshold for determining the extent to which agencies have met the standards, (2) how standards apply differently at the program and project levels, (3) how standards are interrelated to work in a synchronized way, and (4) how standards should be applied across the life cycle of a program or project. (Recommendation 1) The Deputy Director for Management of OMB, in conjunction with the PMPC, should create a governance structure to further develop and maintain program and project management standards that fully aligns with key practices for governance structures. (Recommendation 2) The Deputy Director for Management of OMB should, when expanding PMIAA to additional program types, design pilot efforts to follow leading practices so that OMB can optimize its efforts to improve and broaden portfolio reviews across a full range of program types. (Recommendation 3) The Deputy Director for Management of OMB should communicate program areas and timeframes, and expectations pertinent to annual program portfolio reviews, to be reviewed in future program portfolio reviews. (Recommendation 4) The Deputy Director for Management of OMB should clarify for agencies how the different definitions of a “program” relate to each other in OMB guidance. (Recommendation 5) The Deputy Director for Management of OMB should convene trilateral meetings between OMB, relevant agencies, and us for addressing all high-risk areas during each two-year high-risk cycle (Recommendation 6). The Deputy Director for Management of OMB, in conjunction with PMPC, should ensure PMPC meeting agendas include time for discussing high- risk areas during meetings and provide time for the PMPC to make recommendations to OMB about addressing high-risk areas. (Recommendation 7) The Deputy Director for Management of OMB, in conjunction with PMPC, should establish measures to assess outcomes of PMIAA, such as establishing a baseline of information on programs or collecting trend data. (Recommendation 8) We provided a draft of this product for comment to OMB, OPM, and the five selected agencies. OMB neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations and stated that it would take them into consideration when making future updates to its policies and guidance for agencies for improving program and service delivery. In addition, OMB, OPM, Commerce, NASA, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs provided technical comments which we incorporated as appropriate. Energy responded that it had no comments. We are sending copies of this report to congressional committees, the Acting Director of OMB and Director of OPM, The Secretaries of the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, the Administrator of NASA, and other interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-6806 or Jonesy@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix II. This report examines: (1) the steps taken by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and the Chief Financial Officer Act of 1990 (CFO Act) agencies to implement the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act (PMIAA); (2) the extent to which OMB is using or planning to use portfolio reviews required in PMIAA to address issues on our High-Risk List; and (3) the extent to which OMB provided methods for agencies to assess the results of PMIAA. To examine the steps taken by OMB, OPM, and CFO Act agencies to implement PMIAA, we reviewed agency documents, designed and disseminated a questionnaire to the 24 CFO Act agencies, and analyzed their responses. We also selected five PMIAA CFO Act agencies as case studies. We reviewed documentation from OMB, including the OMB PMIAA strategic plan and actions taken, as well as Cross Agency Priority goal 11 quarterly reports, and screen shots of PMIAA documents on OMB Max portal. We interviewed OMB staff to gain insight into their approach to implementing PMIAA. To examine the OMB standards for program and project management, we used criteria from the Project Management Institute (PMI) for Standard for Program Management and the Project Management Body of Knowledge. In addition, we reviewed documentation from OPM regarding their PMIAA plans and documents for the update of the 0340 job series. We further analyzed Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) data from fiscal year 2018 from OPM to identify employees in current program management 0340 occupational series. We also interviewed OPM officials regarding their role in implementing PMIAA. We interviewed outside subject matter specialists to provide their views on federal program and project management. Specifically, we met with staff from PMI and Professor Janet Weiss from the University of Michigan—who had conducted a study on how to improve federal program management—as she had been recommended by the Congressional Research Service, OMB, and the IBM Center for the Business of Government. To examine the steps agencies had taken, we requested PMIAA implementation plans from all 24 CFO Act agencies. CFO Act agencies were to submit PMIAA implementation plans to OMB by November 30, 2018. We collected implementation plans between November 29, 2018, and April 16, 2019. We received 22 out of 24 implementation plans. We did not review plans from the Department of Health and Human Services or the Environmental Protection Agency because they had not completed their plans at the time of our review. Two analysts independently reviewed separate implementation plans. These reviews were then verified by another analyst. Implementation plans were evaluated on whether they fully met, partially met, or did not meet the 10 requirements provided in the OMB implementation guidance, such as how the major acquisition portfolios aligned to relevant strategic objectives, or whether the agency had existing training for program and project managers. We also disseminated a questionnaire to all CFO Act agencies to collect information on PMIAA implementation. This questionnaire was pre-tested by two CFO Act agencies and two members of the Federal Program and Project Management Community of Practice and revised for clarity. The questionnaire was sent to all 24 CFO Act agencies on February 4, 2019, and responses collected between February 11 and April 22, 2019. All 24 agencies responded to the questionnaire. Agency officials were asked questions on: 1. the steps their agency has taken to implement PMIAA, 2. the challenges their agency faces in implementing PMIAA, 3. efforts to address high-risk issues, and 4. plans to measure PMIAA outcomes, if any. We selected five agencies for case studies and analyzed further documentation and interviewed agency officials to provide illustrative examples of PMIAA implementation at the agency level. We assessed whether: agencies had responsibility for a program, function, or operation on our 2019 High-Risk List; OMB considered them further along in PMIAA implementation compared to other agencies; the agency reported it was selected for the OMB pilot of noninformation technology acquisition program portfolio reviews; agency officials reported actions taken to direct internal program management training or workforce development in their questionnaire responses or OMB required implementation plans; and agency officials reported any actions to implement PMIAA beyond the requirements listed in the OMB PMIAA strategic plan. To achieve of a range of PMIAA experiences, we selected five agencies that met varying numbers of the criteria. The Department of Commerce was chosen because all four selection criteria were met, the Department of Energy met three, the Department of Veterans Affairs met two, and the Department of the Treasury and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration each met one. We interviewed and reviewed documents from each of the agencies. We asked questions about steps agencies were taking and their interactions with OMB and OPM to help them implement PMIAA. We also asked these agencies to suggest any ways in which OMB and OPM could improve implementation. To assess the OMB PMIAA strategic plan, we reviewed leading practices on strategic planning from our body of work. We also considered testimonial evidence from OMB staff. Specifically, we reviewed prior reports on leading strategic planning practices and requirements for agencies to use in strategic planning. We selected relevant criteria from the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) and the GPRA Modernization Act, that not only pertained to agency strategic plans, but also were relevant as for strategic planning principles. Specifically, we selected criteria from the following categories: (1) mission statement; (2) general goals and objectives; (3) strategies for accomplishing goals and objectives; (4) input from stakeholders; (5) interagency collaboration; 6) milestones and metrics to gauge progress. To determine the extent to which the leading practice was included in the strategic plan, we assessed documentary evidence from the PMIAA strategic plan and testimonial evidence from OMB staff as defined below: A practice was categorized as fully met if the evidence fulfilled all aspects of the definition. A practice was categorized as partially met if the evidence fulfilled some, but not all, aspects of the definition, or if the evidence was judged to fulfill the general meaning of the definition, while not technically meeting it fully. A practice was categorized as not met if no evidence was found relevant to the criterion, or if evidence did not fulfill any aspects of the definition. In addition, we reviewed documents from and interviewed selected agencies on what measures OMB was developing for evaluating PMIAA implementation. We also asked these agency officials what kinds of evaluative measures would be useful to monitor the successful implementation of PMIAA from their perspective. In addition, we assessed the pilot of the required PMIAA program portfolio reviews against the five leading practices we identified from our work on designing pilots. We determined that the design fully met the criteria when we saw evidence that all aspects of a leading practice were met. When we were unable to assess whether all aspects of a leading practice were met without additional information, we determined that the design partially met the criteria. Finally, when we saw no evidence of a leading practice, we determined that the criteria were not met. To examine OMB’s standards for program and project management, we selected two sets of criteria for program and project management criteria from PMI. PMI standards are generally recognized as leading practices for program and project management. To select program management standards, we identified 10 PMI program management activities. To select project management standards, we identified 10 project management knowledge areas. Further, PMI’s leading practices were selected to explain how program and project management standards apply differently, and how both set of standards relate to the lifecycle of a program or project. We then compared the definition of these 10 PMI program and 10 PMI project management standards to the definition of OMB’s initial 15 program and project standards released for PMIAA implementation. In addition, OMB’s initial standards were compared to PMI leading practices that distinguish the relationship between programs and projects and leading practices on applying standards across the life cycle of a program or project. We also applied leading practices we identified from our previous work on data governance standards to assess the governance process OMB used to develop, maintain, and monitor program management standards. Our past work identified common key practices for establishing effective data governance structures. This work selected a range of organizations, including domestic and international standards-setting organizations, industry groups or associations, and federal agencies, to ensure we had comprehensive perspectives of data governance key practices across several domains. Two analysts compared the five key practices on the data governance structures to OMB plans and documented practices. We assessed the reliability of OPM’s EHRI data through electronic testing to identify missing data, out of range values, and logical inconsistencies for employees classified as 0340s. We believe the EHRI data we used are sufficiently reliable for the purpose of this report. To examine the extent to which OMB is using or planning to use portfolio reviews to address our High-Risk-List, we reviewed documentation from OMB and 24 CFO Act Agencies. As part of our questionnaire, we asked 24 CFO Act agencies to provide any of our High-Risk List summary and detailed analyses that the agencies were required to submit to OMB as part of the 2018 strategic review process. We analyzed this information to determine the extent to which agencies provided information to OMB during their 2018 strategic review process. We also selected criteria from the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government on maintaining documentation of the internal control system to assess steps that OMB had taken related to its responsibilities for conducting high-risk portfolio reviews and the management of the Program Management Policy Council. Specifically, we selected information and communication which states that management should externally communicate the necessary quality information that an entity needs to achieve its objectives. We conducted this performance audit from June 2018 to December 2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Yvonne D. Jones, (202) 512-6806, or jonesy@gao.gov.

Specifically, abuse deficiencies comprised less than 1 percent of the total deficiencies in each of the years we examined, which is likely conservative. Abuse in nursing homes is often underreported by residents, family, staff, and the state survey agency, according to CMS officials and stakeholders we interviewed. However, abuse deficiencies more than doubled—from 430 in 2013 to 875 in 2017—over the 5-year period. (See appendix II.) In addition, abuse deficiencies cited in 2017 were more likely to be categorized at the highest levels of severity— deficiencies causing actual harm to residents or putting residents in immediate jeopardy—than they were in 2013. In light of the increased number and severity of abuse deficiencies, it is imperative that CMS have strong nursing home oversight in place to protect residents from abuse; however, we found oversight gaps that may limit the agency’s ability to do so. Specifically, we found that CMS: (1) cannot readily access data on the type of abuse or type of perpetrator, (2) has not provided guidance on what information nursing homes should include in facility-reported incidents, and (3) has numerous gaps in its referral process that can result in delayed and missed referrals to law enforcement. In our June 2019 report, we found that CMS’s data do not allow for the type of abuse or perpetrator to be readily identified by the agency. Specifically, CMS does not require the state survey agencies to record abuse and perpetrator type and, when this information is recorded, it cannot be easily analyzed by CMS. Therefore, we reviewed a representative sample of 400 CMS narrative descriptions—written by state surveyors—associated with abuse deficiencies cited in 2016 and 2017 to identify the most common types of abuse and perpetrators. From this review, we found that physical abuse (46 percent) and mental/verbal abuse (44 percent) occurred most often in nursing homes, followed by sexual abuse (18 percent). Furthermore, staff, which includes those working in any part of the nursing home, were more often the perpetrators (58 percent) of abuse in deficiency narratives, followed by resident perpetrators (30 percent) and other types of perpetrators (2 percent). (See appendix III for examples from our abuse deficiency narrative review.) CMS officials told us they have not conducted a systematic review to gather information on abuse and perpetrator type. Further, based on professional experience, literature, and ad hoc analyses of deficiency narrative descriptions, CMS officials told us they believe the majority of abuse is committed by nursing home residents and that physical and sexual abuse were the most common types. This understanding does not align with our findings on the most common types of abuse and perpetrators represented in CMS’s data on deficiencies cited as abuse. Without the systematic collection and monitoring of specific abuse and perpetrator data, CMS lacks key information and, therefore, cannot take actions—such as tailoring prevention and investigation activities—to address the most prevalent types of abuse or perpetrators. To address this, we recommended that CMS require state survey agencies to report abuse and perpetrator type in CMS’s databases for deficiency, complaint, and facility-reported incident data and that CMS systematically assess trends in these data. HHS concurred with our recommendation and stated that it plans to implement changes in response. As of November 2019, HHS had not implemented the recommendation. Despite federal law requiring nursing homes to self-report allegations of abuse and covered individuals to report reasonable suspicions of crimes against residents, in June 2019 we reported that CMS had not provided guidance to nursing homes on what information they should include in facility-reported incidents, contributing to a lack of information for state survey agencies and delays in their investigations. Specifically, officials from each of the five state survey agencies told us that the documentation they receive from nursing homes for facility-reported incidents can lack key information that affects their ability to triage incidents and determine whether an investigation should occur and, if so, how soon. For example, officials from two state survey agencies we interviewed said they sometimes have to conduct significant follow-up with the nursing homes to obtain the information they need to prioritize the incident for investigation—follow-up that delays and potentially negatively affects investigations. Incomplete incident reports from nursing homes are particularly problematic given that nearly half of abuse deficiencies cited between 2013 and 2017 were identified through facility-reported incidents, which is dramatically different than the approximately 5 percent of all types of deficiencies that were identified in this manner. Therefore, facility-reported incidents play a unique and significant role in identifying abuse deficiencies in nursing homes, making it critical that incident reports provided by nursing homes include the information necessary for state survey agencies to prioritize and investigate. To address this issue, we recommended that CMS develop and disseminate guidance— including a standardized form—to all state survey agencies on the information nursing homes and covered individuals should include on facility-reported incidents. HHS concurred with our recommendation and stated that it plans to implement changes in response. As of November 2019, HHS had not implemented the recommendation. In June 2019, we identified gaps in CMS’s process for referring incidents of abuse to law enforcement and, if appropriate, to MFCUs. These gaps may limit CMS’s ability to ensure that nursing homes meet federal requirements for residents to be free from abuse. Specifically, we identified issues related to (1) referring abuse to law enforcement in a timely manner, (2) tracking abuse referrals, (3) defining what it means to substantiate an allegation of abuse—that is, the determination by the state survey agency that evidence supports the abuse allegation, and (4) sharing information with law enforcement. We made recommendations that CMS address each of these four gaps in the referral process, and HHS concurred with each recommendation and stated that it plans to implement changes in response. As of November 2019, HHS had not implemented these recommendations. One of the gaps in CMS’s process is related to referring abuse to law enforcement in a timely manner. For example, law enforcement investigations can be significantly delayed because CMS requires a state survey agency to make referrals to law enforcement only after abuse is substantiated—a process that can often take weeks or months. Officials from one law enforcement agency and two MFCUs we interviewed told us the delay in receiving referrals limits their ability to collect evidence and prosecute cases—for example, bedding associated with potential sexual abuse may have been washed, and a victim’s wounds may have healed. As such, we recommended that CMS require state survey agencies to immediately refer to law enforcement any reasonable suspicion of a crime against a resident. HHS concurred with our recommendation and stated that it plans to implement changes in response. As of November 2019, HHS had not implemented this recommendation. In conclusion, while nursing home abuse is relatively rare, our June 2019 report shows that abuse deficiencies cited in nursing homes are becoming more frequent, with the largest increase in severe cases. It is imperative that CMS have more complete and readily available information on abuse to improve its oversight of nursing homes. It is also essential that CMS require state survey agencies to immediately report incidents to law enforcement if they have a reasonable suspicion that a crime against a resident has occurred in order to ensure a prompt investigation of these incidents.

The benefit is based on an average reduction in earning capacity across a group of individuals with similar physical or mental impairments. Disability compensation is generally paid according to the severity of the service- connected condition and is awarded in 10 percent increments, based on criteria in the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD or rating schedule). Veterans may claim more than one medical condition, and VBA assigns a rating percentage for each condition determined to be connected to the veteran’s service. For veterans with multiple service-connected conditions, VA calculates a rating (combined disability rating) using a table that applies a formula for combining multiple ratings into a single rating. The rating affects the amount of monthly compensation received by a veteran. Unlike some private-sector disability programs, the employment status, earnings, and ability to work generally are not factored into the disability rating and subsequent base payment. Moreover, unlike typical workers’ compensation programs for permanent impairments, no limits are generally placed on the length of time veterans can receive payments. Obligations for disability compensation have increased by 45 percent in the last 5 years, from about $54 billion in fiscal year 2013 to about $78 billion in fiscal year 2018. According to VA, this increase is due to several factors, including more beneficiaries (for example, as veterans of more recent conflicts leave military service and seek compensation), as well as rising average disability ratings that lead to higher average payments. VA reported that growth in the number of veterans with a service-connected condition is concentrated among those rated 50 percent or higher. VBA’s Compensation Service sets policy and oversees the process for determining eligibility for disability compensation. VBA staff in the regional offices process disability compensation claims. These claims processors include Rating Veterans Service Representatives (RVSR or rater), who decide on benefit entitlement and the rating percentage, and Veterans Service Representatives (VSR), who gather evidence needed for the raters to make their decisions and later authorize payment, if any. Claims processors use the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS)—an electronic, paperless system—to maintain, review, and make rating decisions for veterans’ claims. VBA’s reevaluation process determines whether veterans’ service- connected conditions may have changed, due to treatment or other factors, in the years following an initial evaluation for disability compensation. This process helps ensure that veterans’ service- connected conditions are being rated and compensated correctly. A first step in the process is deciding whether a condition may need to be reevaluated at a future date. As part of an evaluation for disability compensation, claims processors review medical evidence and consider whether to schedule a future review date (see fig.1). When the scheduled review date arrives, VBA revisits the case to determine whether a reevaluation of the disabling condition is still appropriate. This pre-exam review involves reviewing the veteran’s records to determine if the veteran is still experiencing similar symptoms. After this review, VBA may conduct, postpone, or cancel a reevaluation. If the reevaluation is conducted, a medical exam may be ordered, after which the rater will rate the condition based on exam results and other medical evidence. VBA regulations specify certain conditions that require reevaluation. In other instances, VA has discretion in whether to conduct reevaluations, determined upon review of a veteran’s medical record. For example, the medical record may suggest that a veteran with limited range of motion will be continuing physical rehabilitation and is expected to improve. Whether the reevaluation is required or discretionary, VBA’s regulations outline several exclusions that place limits on when VBA conducts reevaluations, such as if the veteran’s combined disability rating would not change as a result of a reduced evaluation for one or more conditions. Veterans may generally obtain health care through (1) VA medical facilities, (2) non-VA health care providers in the community for which VA pays (called community care), or (3) providers paid through veterans’ own health insurance. For VA medical facilities, VHA determines eligibility and priority for VA health care, enrolls veterans, and oversees 172 VA medical centers and over 1,000 outpatient facilities. In response to the Veterans’ Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, VHA developed a priority system to balance demand for health care with available resources. The system has eight priority groups, and first priority is generally given to veterans with service-connected conditions rated 50 percent or more and to veterans deemed unemployable because of service-connected conditions. Priority groups 2 and 3 include veterans with service-connected conditions rated 30 or 40 percent, or 10 or 20 percent, respectively, according to VHA. Veterans may be eligible for community care if, for example, VA does not offer the care or service the veteran requires, or when a VA medical facility is unable to provide the care or services consistent with the agency’s access standards. Before receiving health care through VA community care programs, veterans must generally obtain authorization from VA. The total number of veterans enrolled in VA’s health care system rose from 7.9 million to over 9 million from fiscal years 2006 through 2017. During that period, VHA’s budget more than doubled, from $37.8 billion to $92.3 billion, as health care costs were rising and its community care programs were expanding. In fiscal year 2017, VA obligated $13.6 billion of its budget for community care, and in fiscal year 2018, this increased to $14.9 billion. For health care services delivered outside of VHA medical facilities that are not funded by VA, veterans may use private health insurance. A 2018 VA survey of veterans enrolled in VA’s health care system found that about 28 percent reported being covered by private insurance. VBA tracks its performance in providing timely and accurate disability compensation decisions to veterans. VBA considers a decision to be timely if a veteran’s claim is processed within 125 days. As part of its quality assurance efforts, VBA conducts national and individual reviews of the accuracy of claims decisions, and periodic consistency studies to assess claims processors’ knowledge of regulations and guidance on specific claims processing issues, such as when to conduct reevaluations. At the VBA central office level, procedures call for VA to assess the accuracy of a random sample of completed claims from each regional office using its Systematic Technical Accuracy Review (STAR) method. STAR reviewers use a standardized checklist to review all actions taken in processing a claim and record any errors they find. VA reports national and regional office performance data for claim- based accuracy (based on the entirety of the claim) and issue-based accuracy (based on each of the individual medical conditions rated). In fiscal year 2018, VBA reported claim-based rating accuracy of about 90 percent and issue-based accuracy of about 95 percent. At the VBA regional office level, quality review teams conduct Individual Quality Reviews of individual claims processors’ work. For example, VA’s procedures call for reviews to be performed on five claims for every rater per month. The reviews are used to help assess individual claims processors’ performance. In addition to accuracy reviews, VBA’s national quality assurance efforts include periodic consistency studies on specific claims processing issues. These studies are intended to assess how consistently claims processors are making decisions across all regional offices by testing select claims processors on their knowledge of VBA’s regulations and procedures. Improvements in a veteran’s service-connected conditions and improvements in a veteran’s health outcomes have important differences. Federal law requires disability compensation to be based upon an average reduction in earning capacity across a group of individuals with a similar physical or mental impairment. In addition, for certain service- connected conditions such as amputations, VA evaluates the condition based on loss or loss of function of a body part or system, without considering assistive devices or prosthetics. As such, some service- connected conditions, such as hearing loss, are generally not expected to improve for purposes of disability compensation. In contrast, according to VHA research, a veteran’s use of a hearing aid is an example of a successful health outcome because this assistive technology can treat the symptoms of hearing loss and increase the functioning of a person. For health care delivered at VA medical facilities, our analysis of fiscal year 2018 VA data shows that more than half of veterans receiving disability compensation used VA health care for a service-connected condition. Specifically, we determined that about 54 percent of veterans, or about 2.6 million, who received disability compensation had at least one VA outpatient visit related to a service-connected condition. Veterans with higher combined disability ratings had more outpatient visits related to their service-connected conditions, on average. (See fig. 2.) Veterans using VA health care for service-connected conditions had an average of four such conditions, and the median age was 63. For veterans with the most prevalent service-connected conditions, in fiscal year 2018 the average number of visits ranged from about 6 to 11 (see table 1). The highest average number of visits was for veterans with service-connected post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and diabetes. For the same year, veterans receiving disability compensation had an average of nearly eight outpatient health care visits for service-connected conditions. In fiscal year 2018, about 13 percent of VA inpatient hospital stays for veterans receiving disability compensation were to treat a service- connected condition; about 87 percent of the stays for this population were to treat non-service-connected conditions. Nearly 2.1 million, or about 44 percent of veterans receiving disability compensation, had no VA outpatient visits or inpatient stays for their service-connected conditions. These veterans may have received treatment paid for through private insurance, from community care, or received no treatment for their service-connected conditions in fiscal year 2018. Veterans who did not use VA health care had an average of about four service-connected conditions, and the median age was 57. For community care (VA-funded health care delivered by non-VA providers), we could not determine the extent to which veterans receiving VA disability compensation used these health providers for their service- connected conditions because this area is not a focus of analysis for the program, according to VHA Office of Community Care officials. These officials told us that, other than for emergency care claims, information on service-connected conditions is not used to process authorizations and payments for the program because program eligibility is based on other factors, such as the availability of needed services. Veterans also receive health care outside of VHA facilities that is not funded by VA, such as through their private health insurance, and the number and types of these services for service-connected conditions are largely unknown. According to a statutorily mandated study of the use of VA’s health care system, these data are limited. The authors of this study recommended that VA consider expanding data collection efforts. VA has since worked with the Department of Health and Human Services’ Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to expand its data collection regarding veterans, including veterans receiving disability compensation, specifically regarding veterans’ use of non-VA care and coordinating such care with VA providers. Data from this effort will be available beginning in fiscal year 2020, according to Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality researchers conducting the study. Health outcomes of veterans with service-connected conditions who receive VA health care services are not well understood, as they have not been specifically studied outside of veterans receiving disability compensation for PTSD. Based on a review of peer-reviewed literature and interviews with VA health research officials, we identified two studies on the health outcomes of veterans, both of which specifically focused on health outcomes for veterans receiving disability compensation for PTSD. One study published in 2011 found that receiving disability compensation benefits for PTSD was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in PTSD symptoms and reductions in poverty and homelessness. Another study published in 2017 found that 10 percent of men and 20 percent of women who applied for disability compensation for PTSD had a persistent serious mental illness, and over time, consistently reported more severe PTSD symptoms and poorer functioning in comparison to other study participants without severe mental illness. The study authors noted that serious mental illness was more prevalent in this population than in the VA health care system overall. They concluded that more information is needed about the characteristics of those receiving disability compensation to better understand their challenges and long-term outcomes. VA’s Health Services Research and Development office sponsors research on health conditions common in the veteran population, such as traumatic brain injury and Gulf War Illness, among others. According to an official from this office, data used for these studies generally do not include veterans’ receipt of disability compensation or their specific service-connected conditions. Several health care researchers within VA and a VA official we spoke with cited various reasons for limited research on health outcomes for veterans with service-connected conditions. According to these officials, a key challenge is that VBA and VHA data do not use the same identifiers for medical conditions that are needed to link the two information sources. VA health care researchers acknowledged benefits to including veterans’ VBA disability codes in their studies to analyze health information for veterans with service-connected conditions. A 2007 report on the options for improving the disability program also noted that the use of common diagnostic categories would allow VA program managers and researchers to compare populations and trends that would help in program planning and in epidemiological and health services research. However, VBA’s diagnostic codes are unique and do not allow comparisons of trends in disabilities in populations served by VHA or the Department of Defense. According to a VA health care researcher and a VHA official, also contributing to these challenges are the lack of data use agreements, which could better facilitate linking VBA and VHA administrative data for VA to further study health outcomes for this population. For example, according to a VA researcher, linking these data sources could allow researchers to investigate causal relationships between disability compensation and veterans’ health outcomes. We previously reported that such agreements can specify which data can be accessed and for what purpose, the duration of access, and requirements for safeguarding the data and ensuring confidentiality. VBA officials said that while they routinely share data with VHA for operational purposes, obtaining access to VBA data for research purposes has special requirements and is more cumbersome. Agency health care data are stored in VHA’s Corporate Data Warehouse, while benefits data are stored in VBA’s data warehouse. Both VHA and VBA officials noted that their data contain sensitive information and that access is carefully monitored. VA’s fiscal year 2018-2024 Strategic Plan includes goals and objectives for data-driven decision making, which include having comprehensive data to identify and meet veterans’ needs, as well as to understand the outcomes VA provides veterans and focus VA’s improvement efforts. In addition, we have previously reported that agencies can enhance and sustain their collaborative efforts by defining common outcomes, leveraging resources, and establishing compatible policies, among others. These practices include articulating agreements in formal documents, which can strengthen the commitment to working collaboratively, as well as establishing compatible policies and other means (including compatible standards and data systems) to operate across agency boundaries. VA has begun to consider ways to analyze health care services received by veterans with service-connected conditions. VA’s Office of Enterprise Integration (OEI) is tasked with providing analysis to inform VA decision- making, as well as to align planning and implementation across VA programs and initiatives. According to an OEI official, it plans to convene subject matter experts from VBA and VHA to determine options and pilot strategies to link available data, but has not yet determined the scope, specific activities, or timeframes for this effort. Until VA develops and implements a plan to address challenges that have hindered analysis thus far and enhance collaboration between VBA and VHA with regard to such analysis, VA will not be positioned to understand the characteristics, needs, and health outcomes of veterans with service-connected conditions, which available research suggests may be different from other veterans. VBA uses some information on conditions identified as potentially needing reevaluations; however, it is not analyzing and using trend and outcome information from completed reevaluations to inform which service-connected conditions to reevaluate in the future. Reevaluations of veterans’ service-connected conditions can serve as a proxy to gauge change, including improvement, in health. VBA assesses changes in veterans’ disabling conditions from reevaluations it conducts for various reasons, including evidence of potential improvement or when required by the rating schedule. A reevaluation showing a change in a given condition may result in one of three possible outcomes: an increase, decrease, or no change in the veteran’s associated disability rating. VBA developed a report to help identify unnecessary reevaluations, which included information on veterans’ conditions that are initially flagged by raters for potentially needing reevaluations in the future. Developed in 2017, VBA’s report identified potential reevaluations deemed unnecessary per VA’s regulations. For example, regulations state that veterans older than 55 are generally exempt from reevaluation, according to the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG). As part of this process, potential reevaluations identified as unwarranted by VBA’s report would be cancelled before their scheduled review dates arrived. This report also includes information on specific conditions identified for potential reevaluation, including the subset of conditions required by regulation to be reevaluated. For example, according to the data generated by the report in June 2019, PTSD was the most common condition identified for potential reevaluation, and of the conditions requiring reevaluation, prostate cancer was most common. However, VBA officials explained that if the report were to find that any of the cases were for veterans older than 55, the reevaluation would be deemed unwarranted and the scheduled review date for considering reevaluation would be cancelled. According to VBA officials, using this report helped VBA identify and cancel about 70,000 potential reevaluations deemed unnecessary, saving about $29 million. VBA plans to run similar reports as needed to identify more reevaluations that could be cancelled, according to officials. Additionally, VBA officials said that they have data on the specific conditions for which medical exams are ordered as part of the reevaluation process. Ordering exams for reevaluations occurs after a condition identified for potential reevaluation has been reviewed and a decision has been made to proceed with a reevaluation. In particular, VBA’s Exam Management System tracks exams ordered, including exams for reevaluations, and provides information about the associated conditions. However, this system does not provide information on the outcome of a reevaluation decision based on the information from these exams. While VBA has some insight into conditions set to be reevaluated, management lacks information on completed reevaluations, including (1) trends and comparisons of certain reevaluated conditions and (2) rating outcomes of reevaluation decisions for individual service-connected conditions. Reevaluation trends. VBA officials told us that they analyze trends on the numbers of veterans who have had reevaluations. However, they said they do not analyze reevaluation data to identify trends on whether certain conditions are frequently or infrequently reevaluated, including for conditions requiring reevaluation under VBA regulation. Further, although VBA has a mechanism to identify potential reevaluations for veterans with conditions requiring them, it is not analyzing the broader universe of veterans with these conditions, according to VBA officials. Such information could determine the extent to which conditions are being identified for reevaluation as required as well as the outcomes or results of these reevaluations. This trend information could also help VBA determine whether claims processors are conducting reevaluations as needed or required. Reevaluation outcomes. VBA officials said that they do not analyze information on the outcomes of reevaluation decisions for individual conditions (i.e., whether a reevaluation resulted in an increase, decrease, or no change to the rating of a particular condition). According to our analysis of VBA data, reevaluations rarely result in changes to veterans’ combined ratings. Specifically, from fiscal years 2013 through 2018, about 95 percent of reevaluations resulted in no changes to combined ratings for veterans, with about 3 percent resulting in an increase and less than 1 percent resulting in a decrease. Combined ratings alone do not offer insight into what impact reevaluations may have on ratings for individual conditions, including which ones are improving as a result of treatment. Most veterans have multiple conditions that contribute to a combined disability rating. VA reported that in 2018 veterans receiving disability compensation had an average of about five service-connected conditions. For those receiving reevaluations, this circumstance means that although the rating of one condition may decrease as a result of a reevaluation, the rating of another condition may increase based on the claims processor’s review of the medical evidence. As a result, the combined rating may not decrease despite a decrease in the rating of an individual condition. A recent report examining reevaluations for veterans with PTSD had similar findings. In its review of a sample of veterans, the study found that these veterans rarely saw a reduction in their individual rating for PTSD. In cases where an individual rating was reduced, most saw no reduction in their overall combined rating due to the fact that they had other conditions whose ratings increased and thereby offset any reduction. According to VBA officials, the agency does not analyze data on trends in reevaluated conditions or the outcomes of reevaluation decisions for specific conditions because management has not expressed interest in doing so. Further, officials said that these data are not stored together in the database. Although analyzing these data and developing a report on types of conditions reevaluated and their outcomes is feasible, according to officials, doing so would require additional steps, including analyzing the text of rating decisions. According to VA regulation, reevaluations are intended to verify the continued existence or the current severity of a disability. Federal standards for internal control state that management should establish and operate monitoring activities to evaluate the results of activities and ensure that objectives are met with minimum wasted resources. Moreover, they state that management should design a process that uses the entity’s objectives and related risks to identify the information requirements needed to achieve the objectives and address risks. These standards also state that management should use quality information to achieve the entity’s objectives. Identifying the extent to which VBA is meeting these program objectives and effectively managing resources is difficult without analyzing information about the outcomes of reevaluations for specific conditions. Such analysis could also identify trends indicating conditions with little or no potential for a rating change or missed opportunities to target other conditions likely to change as a result of reevaluations. In recent years, VBA has focused its procedures on reducing the number of unnecessary reevaluations and generally limiting the number of reevaluations conducted overall. Using outcome information could allow the agency to better target the agency’s resources and avoid the risk of unnecessary reevaluations and burdening veterans. Analyzing reevaluation trends and outcomes could also inform existing VBA policy. For example, VA is updating the rating schedule with current medical and earnings loss information, including adding conditions requiring reevaluations. Analyzing information on which conditions are reevaluated and identifying any trends in conditions that improve could help inform future updates to the rating schedule or improve the policies or practices for how the reevaluation process is implemented. VBA uses information to help gauge the timeliness and quality of reevaluation decisions, but has not fully used information related to the consistency of raters’ decisions to address potential training needs, among other issues. VBA tracks its performance in providing veterans with timely and accurate decisions on their disability compensation benefits, and uses such information—including information on reevaluations—to manage the claims process. VBA holds its claims processing staff accountable for their timeliness and accuracy through performance standards for regional office managers and individual claims processors. Timeliness. VBA measures and reports to Congress and the public its total number of claims awaiting completion, including those that have been backlogged (awaiting completion for more than 125 days). According to VA, at of the end of fiscal year 2018 it had about 364,000 disability compensation rating claims awaiting completion. Of this total, about 19,000 were reevaluations, of which fewer than 5 percent were in the backlog. VBA uses additional timeliness measures to hold regional offices accountable by tracking the timeliness of their work in each of five steps or cycles in the claims process, as managed under the National Work Queue (VBA’s system for distributing the claims workload). For example, in fiscal year 2018, preparing a rating decision for a reevaluation took an average of 1.76 days. Quality. VA uses national, regional office, and individual-level data from its accuracy reviews to oversee the quality of rating claims decisions, including reevaluations. Each regional office is to meet the national STAR issue-based target of 96 percent accuracy for the year. For reevaluations, VBA reported both claim-based and issue-based accuracy of about 95 percent for fiscal year 2018. According to VBA officials, in response to a recommendation in the VA OIG’s report on unwarranted reevaluations, in October 2018 VBA updated the STAR national quality review checklist with additional questions on (1) the need for a reevaluation, and (2) the timeframe for future reevaluation. At the individual claims processor level, VA measures accuracy using the results of Individual Quality Reviews as part of claims processors’ performance evaluations. For example, a rater is considered fully successful by achieving 92 to 96 percent accuracy on Individual Quality Reviews for a month, depending on the rater’s experience. In fiscal year 2018, VBA reported that for Individual Quality Reviews, claims processors had a 98.4 percent accuracy rate for reevaluations. Overall, few reevaluations are reviewed because reevaluations are a small proportion of VA’s claims workload. Specifically, of about 102,000 reevaluations completed in fiscal year 2018, about 1,500 were reviewed under STAR and about 10,000 were reviewed in Individual Quality Reviews. In addition to using accuracy information to measure regional office and individual performance, VBA holds regional offices and individual claims processors responsible for correcting their errors. According to VBA officials, the agency uses information from its quality reviews to provide additional guidance and training to regional offices. VBA discusses quality review information, including trends in claims processing errors, through newsletters and periodic conference calls with regional office managers and quality review teams. For example, VBA officials noted that they discussed reevaluation policies and guidance with regional office staff on three occasions between May 2017 and May 2018. Officials at the four regional offices we visited indicated that they disseminated information on reevaluations to claims processors. For example, one office’s quality review team provided additional training on reevaluations to members of the claims processing teams. Quality review team officials in each of the regional offices we visited told us that they disseminate and reinforce guidance to claims processors through periodic meetings, newsletters, or other mechanisms. VBA, however, has not fully used available information about quality to oversee and improve the reevaluation process. Specifically, VBA did not use the results of a study it conducted to further identify and correct gaps in raters’ knowledge of reevaluation processing guidance. This May 2018 study—part of VBA’s quality assurance efforts that include periodic consistency reviews of specific claims processing issues—assessed how consistently raters across regional offices understood VBA’s policies on ordering reevaluations (see table 2). The study team recommended VBA take two actions: 1. Consider having experienced quality review team staff at regional offices provide additional training on reevaluation guidance to raters. 2. Consider reviewing reevaluation decisions at the seven lowest-scoring offices because they were at high risk of inaccuracies. While VBA provided regional offices with results of the May 2018 consistency study, the agency did not implement either recommendation. VBA officials told us that they did not direct regional offices to provide additional training because the agency expected the offices to use the results of the consistency study to plan training on reevaluations for their staff. However, VBA officials told us that not all regional offices provided additional training on reevaluations. Quality review officials at the four offices we visited—which included two of the seven offices the study team identified for further review—told us that they did not provide additional training. Officials at two offices said they had previously provided guidance and training to claims processors on reevaluations. VA’s goals are to ensure timely and accurate claims decisions for veterans. Federal standards for internal control state that management should establish monitoring activities, evaluate the results, and remediate any deficiencies on a timely basis. Consistent with these standards, GAO has previously reported that a key use of performance information is to identify problems and take corrective actions, for example, by changing agency guidance or by providing training. By not implementing the study’s recommendations, VBA is missing an opportunity to identify problems and their root causes as a guide to corrective actions, including training or the improvement of training. Many raters who are trained to make these decisions did not perform well on the consistency study’s initial test. Exploring deficiencies associated with this poor performance could position VA to better manage the reevaluation process. In addition, resources spent in developing the study and analyzing its results were not used as effectively as they could have been. VBA has recently updated its procedures manual to clarify who can determine whether a reevaluation is needed, but has not outlined guidance for the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to perform these tasks. As part of the reevaluation process to assess veterans’ conditions, VBA procedures require claims processors in regional offices to conduct a pre-exam review to determine whether a reevaluation is still appropriate when its scheduled review date arrives (see fig. 3). For the reevaluation process to work effectively, proper procedures must be in place to ensure that claims processors can make informed decisions on whether to reevaluate these conditions. Until its recent update, VBA’s procedures manual stated that staff deemed part of “the rating activity” (defined in the manual as staff including raters who specialize in rating claims) were the only claims processors who were permitted to conduct a pre-exam review to determine whether a reevaluation is warranted. In February 2019, VBA updated its procedures manual to clarify that raters or “locally designated claims processors” may conduct this review. Officials said that Veterans Service Representatives (VSR) may fill this role in some offices. Although VBA’s procedures permit VSRs to conduct pre-exam reviews, VSRs may not be qualified to do so, according to the OIG’s July 2018 report and VBA regional staff we interviewed in 2019. The OIG found that VSRs were ordering exams without raters’ pre-exam reviews, resulting in an estimated 15,500 unwarranted exams (about 29 percent of the cases from the study’s review period). These exams were determined to be unwarranted based primarily on exclusions identified in VA’s procedures that exempt certain veterans from reevaluation (see text box). The report found that, rather than sending claims to raters for pre-exam review, VSRs were ordering exams despite not having the proper training and experience to decide on whether a reevaluation was warranted, such as the specialized knowledge needed to review medical evidence. Officials in regional offices we visited expressed concern about VSRs performing this role. Specifically, staff in three of the four regional offices we spoke with—including raters, supervisors, quality assurance staff, and managers—told us that raters do the pre-exam review in their respective offices because they are the only staff qualified to perform this duty. For example, raters have more experience and training than VSRs in reviewing medical evidence to determine the need for a reevaluation, according to officials from one office. In contrast, supervisors we spoke with at another regional office told us they have opted to have VSRs do the pre-exam review as a way to manage the claims workload and enable raters to focus exclusively on rating claims. However, these supervisors expressed concern that VSR reviews could have a negative impact on quality. VBA officials said they have not outlined guidance for the skills needed to perform the pre-exam review. Rather, VBA officials said that they believe it is most effective to allow the regional offices, which vary widely in size and scope, to have discretion to identify staff to fill this role. Further, VBA officials told us that the recent update to the agency’s procedures did not reflect a policy change broadening which staff can do pre-exam reviews, but rather clarified existing practice under which VSRs were already permitted to perform this task. However, given the OIG findings that VSRs performing this task resulted in many unwarranted exams, defining the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for the pre-exam review could provide assurance that staff who do so are qualified. Federal standards for internal control call for management to clearly assign responsibilities and document internal controls, including who should carry out which roles. Identifying the knowledge, skills and abilities needed by qualified staff to carry out their responsibilities can also help management ensure the entity’s objectives are met. Providing flexibility for regional offices can ease implementation and management of workloads, especially for offices with varied situations. However, providing flexibility does not preclude VBA from outlining the basic knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the pre-exam review. Further, in our prior work we found that VBA has faced challenges in defining roles for its staff, which has led to inconsistencies in the way regional offices operate. We have also found that ambiguous policies provided by other VA programs can pose risks to the quality of the process. Without clarifying in VBA’s procedures manual which knowledge, skills, and abilities are needed to fill roles in the reevaluation process, VBA may be at risk of having unqualified staff continue to order unwarranted reevaluations. This risk, in turn, could result in wasted resources and an undue burden on veterans. Despite recent changes to its procedures manual, VBA has not ensured that its training program reflects the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for relevant staff to conduct pre-exam reviews. VBA oversees national training requirements, including training related to reevaluations, but defers to regional offices to manage other training needs. As entry- level staff, claims processors receive national training from VBA related to their job duties. For raters, this initial training covers reevaluations, including instruction on when and when not to schedule reevaluations, and case studies exploring how to make reevaluation decisions based on medical and other evidence, among other topics. VSRs may also receive general training on reviewing and evaluating evidence and are introduced to reevaluations as they learn about general claim development and ordering exams. In addition to initial training, claims processors must complete 40 hours of training per year consisting of 15 hours of training mandated by VBA and 25 hours determined by each regional office. VBA officials told us that regional offices vary in what training and when delivered to their staff. In addition to this general training, VBA officials told us that VA added controls to the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) system to restrict claims processors’ ability to schedule potential reevaluations, which could reduce the possibility of unqualified staff ordering unwarranted exams during the pre-exam review. Specifically, these controls prevent claims processors from scheduling review dates for potential reevaluations when certain exclusions apply (such as that outlined in VA regulation exempting from reevaluation veterans with the minimum rating for a given condition). Further, claims processors have the ability to request to override the restrictions when they believe a reevaluation is warranted based on the circumstances of the case. These override requests are reviewed by quality assurance staff, who may approve or deny the requests. Although these controls may impose some limits on ordering unwarranted exams, they may not affect the ability of claims processors to order reevaluations in circumstances where these exclusions do not apply and for which they must use their discretion. For example, for veterans who have migraine headaches and who do not fit any of the exclusion criteria, no VBMS controls would restrict claims processors from ordering a reevaluation even if it is not appropriate based on the medical evidence or other circumstances of the case. For these controls and VBA’s procedures to be effective, providing proper training to claims processors making these decisions remains important. VBA officials told us that they did not update training requirements as a result of the recent update to procedures because this update did not constitute a policy change. Rather, they said they revised the procedures to align with the existing practice before the update, in which VSRs were permitted to do pre-exam reviews. Further, officials said that each regional office can designate qualified claims processors to perform the pre-exam review and provide training as necessary. VBA officials also said that they do not believe additional training is necessary for VSRs who may be performing this role because the procedure for ordering exams—a skill for which they have been trained—is the same for all types of exams, including those for reevaluations. Although VSRs receive training on the process of ordering an exam, VBA officials confirmed that VSR coursework does not specifically cover the pre-exam review in the reevaluation process. In contrast, raters receive training on the process of deciding whether a reevaluation is warranted, including reviewing medical evidence and applying exclusions in VBA’s procedures. Further, staff in three of the four regional offices we spoke with, including supervisors, quality assurance staff, and managers, said that VSRs do not have the proper training for this task. For example, they are not trained to review medical evidence to make an informed decision about whether a reevaluation is still warranted, according to officials. Similarly, the OIG found in its 2018 report, which reviewed a sample of claims from March through August 2017, that VSRs were unfamiliar with criteria used to determine whether or not an exam is necessary. Federal standards for internal control highlight the importance of training to develop the relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for key roles. We also have previously identified key practices for training and development that suggest that agencies should have a strategy that includes tracking and other control mechanisms to ensure that the relevant employees receive training in line with their responsibilities. Without ensuring that training reflects the relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities needed by claims processors in VBA regional offices, VBA may find these staff continue to make uninformed and incorrect reevaluation decisions that are not aligned with VBA policy, guidance, and procedures. VA spends substantial time, effort, and billions of dollars per year providing disability compensation, health care, and other forms of assistance that promote the wellness of veterans with service-connected conditions. However, VA does not know whether these efforts improve the health of these veterans on several fronts. While we are encouraged by VA’s interest in considering ways to analyze health outcomes, VA has not yet established a plan for addressing the identified research challenges. Without a plan, VA will not be positioned to understand the characteristics, needs, and health outcomes of veterans with service- connected conditions or how disability compensation and health care work together to help them. Disability reevaluations can shed light on whether veterans’ service- connected conditions have changed. However, the agency could take additional steps to analyze outcome and other data on completed reevaluations. Importantly, tracking and analyzing trends and outcomes could shed light on an apparent contradiction: why the majority of recent reevaluations resulted in no change in veterans’ combined ratings when the regulations state that reevaluations generally should not be conducted in these cases. Without these analyses, VA may be unaware of any reevaluation trends, possible explanations for them, or need to recalibrate guidance or resources to address these issues. Reevaluations represent an investment of resources for VA and the veterans who undergo them. Insights into the effectiveness of the reevaluation process are thus critical for managing VBA’s workload and informing agency policy. Specifically, while VBA tested raters’ knowledge of reevaluation policies in its May 2018 consistency study, it missed opportunities to review reevaluation decisions in the offices at greatest risk of making incorrect decisions, as recommended in the consistency study report. Following up on the report’s findings could also provide insights into root causes of errors in reevaluation decisions, which could inform decisions about additional targeted training or improved guidance. For veterans who show health improvements, VBA’s reevaluation process can ensure they have the correct disability rating and associated benefit payment. However, VBA could better mitigate the risks of making unwarranted reevaluation decisions by clarifying guidance in its procedures manual about the knowledge, skills, and abilities regional office staff need to determine whether a reevaluation should be conducted. Moreover, defining training requirements would help ensure that claims processors who conduct reevaluations have the needed skill sets and that their decisions are aligned with VBA policy and guidance. Ultimately, by enhancing and linking existing information about service- connected conditions and health care and from the results of reevaluations, VA could better understand the health outcomes of veterans who have incurred or aggravated disabling conditions during military service. We are making the following five recommendations to VA: The Secretary of Veterans Affairs should ensure that the Office of Enterprise Integration develops a plan—including milestones and roles and responsibilities for OEI, VBA, and VHA—to address identified challenges that have hindered research on the health care outcomes for service-connected conditions of veterans receiving disability compensation. To align VA’s efforts with the goals of its 2018-2024 Strategic Plan, VA’s development of this plan should be completed and ready for implementation by June 1, 2020. (Recommendation 1) The Under Secretary for Benefits should develop and implement a periodic analysis of program management data for trends in the individual service-connected conditions being reevaluated as well as data on the outcomes of reevaluations. (Recommendation 2) The Under Secretary for Benefits should implement the two recommendations in VBA’s May 2018 consistency study to provide training on how to determine when a reevaluation is needed and review reevaluation decisions for accuracy at the lowest-scoring offices and take corrective action as needed. (Recommendation 3) The Under Secretary for Benefits should clarify guidance in its procedures manual regarding the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to make decisions on whether to reevaluate veterans for changes in their service- connected conditions. (Recommendation 4) The Under Secretary for Benefits should align training requirements with the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for reviewing claims to decide whether to conduct a reevaluation. (Recommendation 5) We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for review and comment. VA provided written comments that are reproduced in appendix I. VA agreed with recommendations 1 and 2, and concurred in principle with our other three recommendations. The comment letter described steps the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) plans to take, or is in the process of taking, to address the recommendations. However, except for recommendations 1 and 2, VA’s proposed actions would not fully address the underlying issues we identified. With regard to recommendation 1 to develop a plan to address challenges to studying health outcomes, VA stated that the Office of Enterprise Integration (OEI) will coordinate with VBA and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to create an operational plan that addresses challenges that have hindered research on health care outcomes for service-connected conditions of veterans receiving disability compensation. VA anticipates completing this plan by June 2020. With regard to recommendation 2 to use information on reevaluations to improve program management, VA stated that VBA plans to expand its review of existing data and reports to analyze trends regarding which service-connected conditions are identified for reevaluation, and review the outcomes or results of these reevaluations. VBA plans to develop and implement this effort by the end of June 2020. With regard to recommendation 3 to implement the recommendations from the 2018 consistency study, VA stated that VBA provided a reminder to all regional offices about the availability of training resources on how to determine when a reevaluation is needed. VA also stated that VBA conducted another consistency study on this issue in August 2019 and plans to inspect claims at the two lowest-scoring regional offices identified in that study by January 15, 2020. We are encouraged by VBA’s plans to use the results of the 2019 study by inspecting claims at the lowest- scoring offices. However, using the results of both the 2018 and 2019 studies would allow VBA to more fully identify and correct root causes of any deficiencies, such as through additional training or the improvement of training. With regard to recommendation 4 to clarify guidance regarding the specific knowledge, skills, and abilities staff need to determine when to reevaluate disability claims, VA recognized the importance of having appropriately skilled and trained employees to process reevaluations and other claims. VA stated that each regional office identifies which employees complete these reviews based on their staff expertise. Further, VA stated that its Systematic Technical Accuracy Review (STAR) results of 95 percent for reevaluations indicate that further action is not needed. We continue to believe that flexibility for regional offices can be balanced with assurance that staff with the appropriate knowledge, skills, and abilities are conducting this work across regional offices. In addition, the STAR accuracy rate provides limited information about the accuracy of decisions to reevaluate claims, as discussed below. As noted in the report, identifying the knowledge, skills and abilities needed by qualified staff to carry out their responsibilities can help management ensure the program’s objectives are met. With regard to recommendation 5 to improve training for reevaluations, VA stated that additional training on reevaluations is not needed because its STAR accuracy rate for reevaluations is 95 percent. As noted in the report, VBA’s STAR reviews a small percentage of all completed reevaluations, and errors related to improperly ordered reevaluations are not reflected in STAR accuracy scores. We believe that additional action is needed to address our recommendation by ensuring staff are trained appropriately on these procedures to correctly determine whether reevaluations are needed. This additional training or guidance is particularly needed given the results of VBA’s May 2018 and August 2019 consistency studies, the views of regional staff we talked with, and the large volume of unwarranted exams.

A visa holder must present himself or herself for inspection at a U.S. port of entry by an officer with DHS’s U.S. Customs and Border Protection to determine admissibility. Nonimmigrants, including foreign students, are permitted to enter the United States for an authorized period of stay. Schools seeking to enroll foreign students on F and M visas must pay an application fee and petition for SEVP certification by submitting an electronic certification petition and supporting documentation to ICE through SEVIS. Among other things, SEVIS assists ICE in tracking and providing oversight of foreign students—while they are approved to study in SEVP-certified U.S. educational institutions—and their accompanying dependents. Figure 1 outlines the steps required for schools seeking to obtain and maintain SEVP certification and the process for foreign nationals to pursue a course of study in the United States. More specifically, during the initial certification process, a school must provide ICE, specifically SEVP’s School Certification Unit (Certification Unit), with evidence of the school’s legitimacy (or bona fides) and eligibility. Such evidence includes the following: proof of any requisite licensure or approval by an appropriate state- level licensing or approving agency; proof of accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education, if accreditation is required or otherwise claimed; DSO’s attestation statement that he or she is familiar, and intends to comply, with program rules and regulations for admission under, and maintenance and change of, nonimmigrant student status; and confirmation by the school that it is eligible for certification, among other things (willful misstatements in a school certification petition may constitute perjury); and DSOs’ proof of U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent residency. In addition, petitioning schools must generally submit a school catalog or written statement including certain information with respect to the qualifications of teaching staff, and attendance and grading policies, among other things. However, the requirement for a school catalog or written statement is not applicable to a public school or school system, a school accredited by a Department of Education–recognized accrediting agency, or a secondary school operated by or as part of such an accredited school. Moreover, an institution of higher education that is not a public educational institution or system, or not accredited by a recognized accrediting body, must provide evidence “in lieu of” meeting those criteria. Such evidence must show either that the school of higher learning confers recognized degrees upon its graduates or its credits have been and are unconditionally accepted by at least three public or accredited institutions of higher education. Schools nominate individuals to serve as DSOs, who act as liaisons between foreign students, the DSOs’ employing school, and federal government agencies. DSOs support school compliance with record- keeping, reporting, and other requirements, and provide recommendations to foreign students regarding the maintenance of their immigration status. In addition to entering and maintaining complete information on students in SEVIS in a timely manner, DSOs are responsible for using SEVIS to submit their school’s certification petition and update the information, as necessary. To demonstrate eligibility, DSOs must, among other things, provide to ICE statements certifying their familiarity and intent to comply with the program rules and regulations relating to the requirements for nonimmigrant students’ admission, maintenance of status, and change of status, and requirements for school approval. ICE’s regulations provide that willful misstatements in certification and recertification submissions may constitute perjury. Once ICE has received a complete petition from a school seeking SEVP certification, staff from SEVP’s Field Representative Unit are to conduct a site visit to the school, including each instructional site foreign students will attend, to interview school officials and review the facilities. After receiving all necessary evidence and a site-visit report from the field representatives, ICE staff in the Certification Unit analyze the documentation, determine the school’s eligibility, and certify those schools that they determine meet all of the program’s requirements. Further, DHS is required to conduct a review, every 2 years, of certified schools’ continued eligibility and compliance with the program’s requirements. To be eligible for recertification, an SEVP-certified school must demonstrate at the time of filing that it remains eligible for certification and has complied during its previous period of certification or recertification with record-keeping, retention, reporting, and other program requirements. During the recertification process, the Certification Unit requires schools to submit the same type of evidence that was required for certification, including, among other things, proof of state licensing and accreditation and DSO attestation statements and citizenship documentation. The Certification Unit also evaluates how the school has ensured that its foreign-student records are accurate and in compliance with statutory record-keeping requirements. However, site visits are not required for recertification. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 states that a material failure of an SEVP-certified school to comply with the record-keeping and reporting requirements to receive foreign students shall result in the suspension for at least 1 year, or termination, of the school’s approval to receive such students. SEVP’s Analysis and Operations Center (Compliance Unit) conducts ongoing monitoring of SEVP-certified schools for compliance with these regulatory record- keeping and reporting requirements, as well as schools’ continued eligibility for certification. Under federal regulation, SEVP can deny an SEVP-certified school’s recertification petition or, subsequent to out-of- cycle review, withdraw certification if the school or its programs are no longer eligible for certification. Denial of recertification or withdrawal on notice as a result of out-of-cycle review may be for any valid and substantive reason, including failure to comply with record-keeping and reporting requirements, willful issuance by a DSO of a false statement, or not operating as a bona fide institution of learning, among other bases. According to federal standards and guidance, executive-branch agency managers are responsible for managing fraud risks and implementing practices for combating those risks. Federal internal control standards call for agency management officials to assess the internal and external risks their entities face as they seek to achieve their objectives. The standards state that, as part of this overall assessment, management should consider the potential for fraud when identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks. Risk management is a formal and disciplined practice for addressing risk and reducing it to an acceptable level. In July 2015, we issued the Fraud Risk Framework, which provides a comprehensive set of key components and leading practices that serve as a guide for agency managers to use when developing efforts to combat fraud in a strategic, risk-based way. The Fraud Risk Framework describes leading practices in four components: commit, assess, design and implement, and evaluate and adapt, as depicted in figure 2. The Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015, enacted in June 2016, requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Comptroller General of the United States, to establish guidelines for federal agencies to create controls to identify and assess fraud risks and design and implement antifraud control activities. The act further requires OMB to incorporate the leading practices from the Fraud Risk Framework in the guidelines. In July 2016, OMB published guidance about enterprise risk management and internal controls in federal executive departments and agencies. Among other things, this guidance affirms that managers should adhere to the leading practices identified in the Fraud Risk Framework. Further, the act requires federal agencies to submit to Congress a progress report each year for 3 consecutive years on the implementation of the controls established under OMB guidelines, among other things. ICE developed a risk-assessment framework and other tools to assist in its efforts to manage fraud risks to SEVP. For example, in 2014, ICE began developing an SEVP Risk Assessment Model and Framework, which provides an overview of how SEVP identifies, assesses, responds to, and reports on identified internal and external risks to the program. Specifically, SEVP’s Risk Assessment Model and Framework—which was updated several times between 2014 and 2017—discusses categories of fraud risks to the program, including fraud associated with schools, DSOs, and students. Moreover, in 2014, ICE developed a Risk Assessment Tool for SEVP that uses data from SEVIS records to identify potential fraud and other noncompliance issues among certified schools. The tool prioritizes different risk indicators—such as the proportion of the school that consists of foreign students—and ranks schools by risk level. SEVP officials stated that schools identified as high risk receive additional administrative review by the Compliance Unit. According to SEVP officials and documentation we reviewed, ICE has continued to update and refine the tool since 2014 to improve its effectiveness in helping to identify program risks, including fraud risks. Through these and its oversight efforts, ICE has identified various fraud risks in SEVP; such risks may take various forms, including immigration benefit fraud, which involves the willful or knowing misrepresentation of material facts for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit, such as a nonimmigrant student status, without lawful entitlement. According to ICE documentation we reviewed and officials we spoke to, the fraud risks to the program generally fall into four broad categories: schools, students, DSOs, and third-party brokers, who are individuals engaged in the fee- or commission-based recruitment of foreign students, among other activities. Figure 3 illustrates the types of fraud that may occur in these four categories during different stages of a certified school’s involvement in the program, as we identified in ICE documentation and through our interviews with ICE officials. For specific examples of fraud risks that ICE has identified in SEVP, see figure 4. ICE has also taken steps since 2012 to strengthen its fraud risk- management efforts in response to our prior recommendations. For example, in our 2012 report on SEVP risks, we found that, among other things, ICE did not have a process to assess risks in SEVP and did not consistently implement existing internal controls for determining school eligibility. To address this and other findings, we made eight recommendations to enhance ICE’s ability to assess program risks, prevent and detect school certification fraud, and improve the controls over SEVP. ICE took action that addressed these eight recommendations and has developed various tools designed to strengthen its fraud risk- management efforts (see app. I). Further, ICE has taken steps to improve collaboration and coordination to enhance fraud risk management between SEVP and CTCEU, the unit within ICE responsible for managing criminal investigations. More specifically, ICE has embedded agents within SEVP’s Compliance Unit, and these agents help provide law-enforcement expertise within the unit and act as liaisons with ICE agents located in the field to provide information and support ongoing criminal investigations. According to a senior ICE official with CTCEU, the embedded agents have helped streamline processes and provide expertise to aid administrative and investigative efforts. Figure 5 shows the process for coordination between CTCEU and SEVP. Further, ICE officials with CTCEU stated they have acquired specialized software tools to manage fraud tips and to conduct open-source and related research on certified schools suspected of acting fraudulently. To help identify and prioritize leads, ICE officials stated that they use a software tool to efficiently help review and prioritize tips received through ICE’s tip line, which gathers tips from the general public on suspicious or potential criminal activity. To aid investigations of schools, ICE explored the use of another specialized software to aid the review of online social media associated with schools or individuals, among other things. In addition, changes to SEVIS have aided ICE’s efforts to manage fraud risks in the program. In 2008, ICE initiated an effort to modernize SEVIS to address identified system vulnerabilities, such as the inability to capture detailed school data that would allow the detection of patterns and anomalies that could indicate fraud. Although SEVIS modernization is not yet complete, changes made in the system have helped to improve system usability and the ability to identify suspected fraud in the program, according to program officials. For example, system edit checks implemented in 2015 and 2016 to verify user-entered names and addresses have enhanced data quality by helping to identify and prevent likely data-entry errors. SEVP officials also stated that improved data quality can help make it easier to distinguish potential fraud from unintentional data-entry errors. ICE officials we spoke to and related documentation we reviewed stated that SEVIS modernization efforts may include additional functionality, such as the ability to create person-centric records for each student. Although ICE has developed a Risk Assessment Model and Framework and taken other action to improve fraud risk management in SEVP, ICE has not fully developed and implemented a “fraud risk profile” that would help guide its efforts. According to our Fraud Risk Framework, an effective antifraud entity tailors the approach for carrying out fraud risk assessments to its programs. This approach allows an agency to, among other things, develop a fraud risk profile that identifies the inherent fraud risks affecting the program, assesses the likelihood and effect of each type of fraud risk that the determines the agency’s tolerance for certain types or levels of fraud risks in the program, examines the suitability of existing controls for each fraud risk, and documents the program’s fraud risk profile. Effective managers of fraud risks use this profile to help decide how to allocate resources to respond to fraud risks. Further, Federal Internal Control Standards require managers to respond to identified risks. Appendix III provides additional information on the key elements in the fraud risk-assessment process including the development of a fraud risk profile. Our assessment of SEVP’s Risk Assessment Model and Framework found that while it describes the program’s approach for managing fraud risks, it does not include all of the key elements of a fraud risk profile: First, SEVP’s Risk Assessment Model and Framework identifies three broad categories of inherent fraud risks that affect the program (those posed by schools, DSOs, and students), but does not include all risks that the program or its stakeholders have identified, such as the risk of third-party brokers. As noted previously, ICE agents and program officials identified brokers as a risk to the program because brokers have helped facilitate school and student fraud and misused or stolen student funds in the past. However, according to ICE officials with SEVP, SEVP’s Risk Assessment Model and Framework was not designed to define all of the risks posed to SEVP. Second, while SEVP’s Risk Assessment Model and Framework assesses the potential effect of its risk posed by students, schools, and DSOs, it does not discuss the likelihood of the risk’s occurrence. For example, the Risk Assessment Model and Framework contains a narrative outlining the potential negative consequences of each of the three broad risk categories but does not address the likelihood of those risks occurring. According to SEVP officials, SEVP’s Risk Register helps identify and determine the likelihood of identified program risks. However, our review of the Risk Register found that it is used to track program-wide risks and does not identify or discuss specific fraud risks. Further, these officials stated that many of the components in a fraud risk profile are included in SEVP’s Risk Assessment Tool, but this tool was developed to prioritize the review of SEVP-certified schools that have potential compliance issues and was not designed to address all SEVP fraud risks such as the risks posed by students or brokers. Using information on the likelihood of risk occurrence can help managers decide how to allocate resources. For example, managers can use this information to make decisions to allocate resources to addressing fraud risks that are most likely to occur or have relatively high impact. Third, SEVP’s Risk Assessment Model and Framework does not assess the agency’s tolerance for all fraud risks to the program. For example, while SEVP officials stated that students represent a significant risk to the program, they have not fully assessed the extent of risks associated with student fraud or the agencies’ tolerance for it. In October 2017, the SEVP Director stated that SEVP was just beginning to get a better understanding of student risks, but had not done an assessment of their likelihood and tolerance. However, SEVP officials acknowledged the importance of fully assessing student risks because of the challenges that can be associated with detecting, preventing, and responding to student fraud. Fourth, SEVP’s Risk Assessment Model and Framework does not examine the suitability of existing fraud controls or prioritize all residual risks that remain after inherent risks have been mitigated by existing control activities. We found that, while the Risk Assessment Model and Framework discusses different internal controls and tools used to prioritize and address risks in the school certification and recertification process, such as the Risk Assessment Tool, it does not explicitly identify any internal controls or tools used to prioritize or address student risks. In addition, the Risk Assessment Model and Framework does not identify and prioritize residual fraud risks that ICE has flagged as being vulnerabilities to the program. According to ICE agents in four field offices and officials in the Compliance Unit, limitations to SEVP’s ability to prevent some schools that present fraud risks from obtaining certification or continuing to participate in the program after fraud risks have been identified represent residual risks to the program. For example, officials in the Compliance Unit stated that certified schools that have been accredited through an accrediting body recognized by the Department of Education generally represent a lower fraud risk, but ICE has still experienced noncompliance and cases of fraud with these schools. At one point several fraud cases were tied to the same accrediting body. In another example of a potential residual risk to the program, ICE field agents stated that potentially fraudulent schools may continue to operate during criminal investigations, which can take several years to investigate and prosecute. During the investigation, schools may remain in operation and continue to enroll foreign students, provided their certification is not withdrawn through other administrative actions. As one example, ICE’s investigation into Prodee University—a case that involved hundreds of students—began in 2011, but warrants were not issued until 2015. The school continued to operate and accept foreign students during the 4-year investigation, creating residual risk to the program during these years. According to SEVP’s Director, the program has not developed a fraud risk profile that fully addresses all identified risks because the program has not yet developed the maturity needed to manage its risks in this way, but she noted that doing so could be a good next step in the process. Without a fraud risk profile consistent with leading practices—which identifies all fraud risks, discusses the likelihood of those risks, assesses the agency’s risk tolerance, and determines the suitability of related controls—ICE cannot ensure it has taken all necessary actions to address SEVP risks. ICE is exploring the use of better data analytics to help detect fraud in SEVP but has not yet employed techniques, like network analysis, to help detect and prevent fraud prior to certification. ICE officials with SEVP stated that they are exploring the use of additional data-analytics tools to help mitigate fraud in the program, including tools that can perform network analysis. However, these efforts are in their early stages and have been limited to conversations between program staff. While previously noted efforts to improve SEVIS may also include additional data analytics to mitigate fraud, these efforts have remained underway since 2008. Agency officials told us they recognize that better analytic tools can help them detect and prevent fraud in the certification process and are seeking additional resources to support this effort. According to agency documentation, SEVP awarded a contract in September 2018 to help establish a data-governance framework within SEVP. Among other things, the contract will examine the tools, skill sets, and number of people needed to support the data-related needs for SEVP, to include operational data and analytics. According to agency officials, SEVP plans to award a contract in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 to provide better data-analytics support. Data-analytics approaches, such as network analysis, have the potential to enable ICE to identify high-risk schools prior to initial certification, thus allowing SEVP to apply increased oversight, as needed, during the adjudication process. Network analysis involves a quantitative approach for analyzing, summarizing, and graphically representing complex patterns of relationships among individuals or organizations. Such a technique is useful for identifying associations, such as between schools with current or past administrative and criminal concerns and those schools seeking certification. Information about the connections and relationships among schools—developed through network analysis—may then provide leads in reviews and investigations in the certification and recertification processes, which are important controls for preventing fraudulent schools from entering and remaining in the SEVP program. ICE field agents with two of five field offices we visited stated that it can be challenging to identify fraudulent schools as compared to legitimate ones during the initial certification of schools. For example, agents familiar with one investigation stated that after ICE began investigating a school for suspected fraud, the owner tried to establish another school, which was only identified because of a lead provided through interviews conducted during the investigation. Further, because tools such as the Risk Assessment Tool use data analytics, but rely on information collected from current SEVP-certified schools, it can be difficult to identify schools with fraud concerns before they are certified to participate in the program. Using a network approach in our analysis of 2,439 SEVP-certified schools, we identified 11 connections that could raise fraud concerns. Specifically, we conducted a network analysis utilizing both public and proprietary information associated with certified schools as of September 2017. We obtained basic information on these schools from ICE, such as school names and addresses. We also used public records associated with these schools related to businesses and people, such as past and current executives. Using this information and freely available public software, we identified relationships among certified schools that ICE had previously identified as having potential compliance or fraud concerns and other certified schools that did not have such concerns. For example, in 11 connections, we identified instances in which an executive appeared to have been employed by a school under active criminal investigation or administrative review who was either previously or later employed by a different school not under investigation or review. Moreover, for 2 of the 11 connections, we found additional derogatory information associated with executives tied to SEVP-certified schools that could raise fraud concerns. For instance, one executive had employment terminated from a previous school and was under investigation for misappropriating school funds for personal use. While these connections do not prove fraud or noncompliance, they do provide information about potential risks, which can inform the prioritization of administrative and investigative resources during certification. ICE currently has limited ability to identify associations among schools with potential fraud concerns before they are certified to participate in the program. According to our Fraud Risk Framework, federal managers should design and implement specific control activities to prevent and detect fraud. These control activities can include data analytics, among other things, and should emphasize fraud prevention to the extent possible. A network approach provides the capability to better prevent and detect fraud by identifying potentially fraudulent schools before they are certified by SEVP and by detecting associations that pose a fraud risk among those already certified. ICE has processes in place for school certification, recertification, and ongoing compliance monitoring, and has taken steps to improve school certification controls since our 2012 report. We also found that ICE followed its established procedures and specifically identified GAO’s fraudulent petitions or otherwise took appropriate steps to prevent the petitions from moving forward in the process during our three independent covert tests of SEVP internal controls over the school certification process. However, the agency continues to face long- standing delays in conducting recertification reviews every 2 years to ensure that SEVP-certified schools continue to meet program requirements—one of its important fraud risk controls. As a result of these delays, ICE has a queue of recertification petitions awaiting adjudication, which creates additional fraud risks to the program if higher-risk schools continue to operate pending recertification. However, the agency has not assessed the magnitude of these risks. ICE’s certification and recertification processes are designed to assess schools’ initial and continued eligibility to enroll foreign students and, as previously discussed, once a school is certified, ICE is to monitor its continued program eligibility. SEVP-certified schools are to undergo recertification reviews every 2 years (see fig. 6). Initial certification: As previously discussed, to be eligible for SEVP certification, a petitioning school must establish at the time of filing that it is a bona fide institution of learning or other recognized place of study that possesses the necessary facilities, personnel, and finances to conduct, and is in fact engaged in, instruction in recognized courses. SEVP officials stated that they address potential fraud risks during the initial certification process by verifying the schools’ information and documentation through web-based research and a site visit to interview the school’s DSO and observe the school’s facilities. According to SEVP officials and guidance, as of October 2016, field representatives are responsible for conducting and documenting site visits for certifications. When conducting the visits, field representatives are to gather evidence on school eligibility for certification, review the facilities, and interview personnel nominated on the petition to become DSOs. They may also report back any anomalies or areas of concerns they may notice for further vetting by the compliance unit. SEVP received approximately 2,000 certification petitions from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. See figure 7 for details on the number of approved and denied petitions during this period. ICE has implemented several controls to address fraud risks in the school certification process since our 2012 report on SEVP program risks, but long-standing delays in the recertification process create additional fraud risks. In particular, ICE strengthened its processes for verifying and monitoring schools’ accreditation and states’ licensing statuses. For example, since December 2012, SEVP adjudicators are to verify all “in lieu of” letters during the school’s initial-certification and recertification processes. In May 2015, SEVP developed a continuous process for verifying schools’ state licensing and accreditation status and updated its Adjudicator’s Manual with specific actions adjudicators must take to consistently verify evidence provided by schools, including “in lieu of” letters and states’ licensing documentation. In addition, SEVP took steps to ensure that all flight schools had the appropriate Federal Aviation Administration certification. Recertification: To be eligible for recertification, an SEVP-certified school must demonstrate at the time of filing that it remains eligible for certification and has complied during its previous period of certification or recertification with record-keeping, retention, reporting, and other program requirements. SEVP received approximately 14,000 recertification petitions from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. See figure 8 for details on the number of approved and denied petitions during this period. The recertification process is an important fraud risk control, according to ICE officials, since they may determine that some certified schools are potentially noncompliant during the recertification process. For example, SEVP denied 105 recertification petitions from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2017. On the basis of our review of recertification denial data, the majority of denials were due to the school’s abandoning its petition for recertification by not responding to SEVP’s request for further information. Appendix IV provides additional details on the withdrawal and denial of certification and recertification petitions as outlined in federal statute and regulation. For the remaining schools, SEVP issued a formal recertification denial notice for a variety of reasons, including those that highlight fraud risks in the program, such as improper issuance of Forms I-20, including the issuance of forms to foreign students who will not be enrolled in or carry a full course of study; DSO conduct did not comply with program regulations; willful issuance by a DSO of a false statement; failure to timely report school or course of study information, including material changes; and failure to maintain the accreditation or licensing necessary to qualify graduates as represented in the school’s Form I-17. Ongoing compliance monitoring: The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 provides that SEVP-certified schools are to comply with record-keeping and reporting requirements to enroll nonimmigrant students. Between schools’ initial certifications and their subsequent recertification reviews, ICE uses a variety of mechanisms to monitor ongoing compliance with program requirements and mitigate fraud risks. For example: SEVP deployed its first group of field representatives in 2014. As of June 2018, ICE had 57 field representatives across 60 different geographic areas of responsibility nationwide. According to SEVP guidance, field representatives are to act as direct liaisons between SEVP and certified schools and are to try to meet with all certified schools in their territory at least once per year if the school has foreign students enrolled, or once every 2 years if no foreign students are enrolled. According to SEVP officials, the field representatives are to have a customer-service focus and assist DSOs in adhering to program requirements and, as a result, do not have law-enforcement or investigative responsibilities. However, if field representatives learn of potential fraud while visiting a school, they are to document and send this information to SEVP headquarters. All of the eight field representatives we interviewed reported that they primarily have a customer-service role but have also identified and reported suspected fraud to SEVP headquarters. For instance, one representative stated that she reported a language school because its stated level of student enrollment did not appear to correspond with the number of students in class during her visits to the school. SEVP adjudicators are to verify and adjudicate changes that occur at an SEVP-certified school that require an update to the school’s Form I-17 petition information in SEVIS. These changes include the school’s name, location, or new areas of study offered, among others. According to Certification Unit officials, adjudicators review information from both SEVP’s risk tools and field-representative school-visit reports when adjudicating updates to identify any indications of noncompliance or fraud that need to be further reviewed and researched by the Compliance Unit. Compliance Unit staff are to vet tips provided by external parties (such as DSOs from other schools) or internal stakeholders (such as field representatives or Certification Unit adjudicators) to determine whether they indicate the need to open an administrative or criminal investigation on the school. Compliance Unit staff may also identify schools for additional monitoring. The Compliance Unit is also responsible for extracting and analyzing data from SEVIS on an ongoing basis, including data related to certified schools and foreign students suspected of noncompliance and fraud, among other things. According to ICE officials, staff are responsible for researching schools with high-risk scores provided by the Risk Assessment Tool. ICE may conduct an out-of-cycle review of a school at any time to help determine whether the school is complying with its reporting and record-keeping requirements and to ensure the school’s continued eligibility for SEVP certification. ICE may initiate an out-of-cycle review as a result of receiving information regarding potential noncompliance or fraud. The out-of-cycle review process may include a review of student records, a request for the submission of documentation to verify accreditation, a request for proof of state licensure, or a request for any other required evidence that establishes a school’s continued eligibility for SEVP certification. ICE officials stated that they may, pending the result of this review, issue a remedial action plan to the school describing the areas of noncompliance, such as correcting student records, that the school is required to address to maintain its program eligibility. If, upon completion of an out-of-cycle review, SEVP determines that a certified school has failed to sustain eligibility or has failed to comply with the record-keeping, retention, reporting, and other requirements, SEVP will institute withdrawal proceedings by serving the school a notice of intent to withdraw SEVP certification. At the conclusion of withdrawal proceedings, a school found to be ineligible for continued SEVP certification as a result of an out-of-cycle review will receive a notice of withdrawal (see app. IV for additional information on the withdrawal process). ICE followed established procedures during our three covert tests of the internal controls over the SEVP school certification process by either successfully identifying GAO’s fraudulent petitions or by taking appropriate steps to prevent the petitions from moving forward in the process. Therefore, we did not identify any significant deficiencies during our testing of these controls. We submitted certification petitions and conducted other covert investigative work for three fictitious schools, all of which have differing certification requirements. Using these schools, GAO agents applied for SEVP certification. For one of the fictitious schools, we tested SEVP certification controls that require schools to submit complete documentation by submitting an application for the school that was missing several of the required documents. Consistent with its procedures, ICE flagged our petition as incomplete and sent us a notification stating that our petition was canceled because we failed to submit all supporting evidence as outlined in the regulations. For our second school, we tested SEVP controls requiring schools to schedule and complete a site visit conducted by an SEVP field representative, by submitting a completed petition, but avoiding the site visit and requesting that our paperwork move forward without it. SEVP’s field representative subsequently notified us that our petition would not move forward until a site visit was performed. For our third fictitious school, we submitted an application, and participated in a site visit with SEVP officials. We tested SEVP controls related to verifying application documentation, and whether SEVP site- visit officials followed established procedures for the site visit. The field representative toured the facilities and interviewed GAO agents posing as school officials. During its review of our petition, ICE took steps to verify our school’s information and discovered that documentation we submitted was fictitious. As a result, SEVP officials subsequently referred our school to ICE agents for further investigation, consistent with ICE policies and procedures. Upon learning that ICE followed its documented internal control processes, we concluded our covert testing. ICE faces long-standing challenges in conducting school recertification on a 2-year basis consistent with statute and regulation, which may allow potentially fraudulent schools to operate for a longer period without detection. The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 states that DHS must conduct compliance reviews every 2 years, during which ICE reviews a school’s records to verify that it continues to comply with program-eligibility requirements. ICE began the first recertification cycle in May 2010—8 years after the enactment of the statutory requirement for periodic review of SEVP-certified schools. As of March 2012—nearly 10 years after statutory enactment—ICE reported that it had recertified approximately 19 percent of certified schools. In October 2016, ICE reported that it had completed its first round of recertification (in other words, all existing certified schools had been recertified at least one time) and had used recertification to address a number of issues, including gathering missing data for some school records. ICE has continued to recertify schools. However, Certification Unit officials told us that, while recertification should be conducted every 2 years, ICE has been unable to meet a 2-year time frame for all certified schools. ICE has been extending schools’ certification expiration dates since officials began recertifying schools in 2010, according to Certification Unit officials, to provide additional time for adjudicating recertification petitions. According to ICE regulations, schools should be notified 180 days before their certification expiration date and must file a completed petition for recertification by such date, which is 2 years from the date of their previous SEVP certification or the recertification expiration date. However, as described in figure 9, SEVP has been extending schools’ certification expiration dates by 180 days beyond the 2-year mark as defined in ICE’s regulation. Under this process, schools must submit their complete petition and supporting documentation to SEVP within 180 days after the 2-year mark. Extending certification expiration dates increases the period between each recertification review, resulting in a decrease in the number of recertification reviews conducted in a given time frame, as shown in the hypothetical example of two schools in figure 10. For instance, if SEVP initially certified a school in January 2016, by providing an extension SEVP is setting the school’s certification expiration date to July 2018—2 years and 180 days after the initial certification—as opposed to 2 years after the initial certification, which would be consistent with ICE regulations. After receiving the school’s documentation, Certification Unit staff need time to review and adjudicate the petition. If this school submits a complete petition to SEVP in June 2018—1 month before its revised expiration date—SEVP staff may and do take additional time, depending on the facts and circumstances of the specific petition, beyond the revised expiration date to adjudicate the petition. SEVP officials stated that, if necessary, they can further extend the certification expiration date to accommodate the time needed for their review. For instance, SEVP may not adjudicate this school’s petition until December 2018. Once SEVP completes its adjudication in December 2018, the school’s new certification expiration date would be June 2021 (2 years and 180 days after December 2018). Thus, rather than potentially being able to complete two rounds of recertification during this 5-year period consistent with ICE regulation, SEVP would recertify the school only once. As we reported in 2012, according to SEVP officials, ICE delayed the recertification process until after SEVIS was deployed in 2003 and the program fee was increased in 2008 to support hiring additional staff. Further, with regard to resources, ICE officials stated that they are cross- training adjudicative staff across all of their program areas to help address the recertification workload, and creating regional adjudication teams with assigned territories similar to the field representatives’ territories to allow the adjudicators to work with the same schools throughout the school’s participation in the program. In addition, in February 2018, SEVP’s Director stated that ICE was expecting to hire additional adjudicators for a total of 10. In July 2018, ICE identified the need to increase initial certification fees and add a new recertification fee to, among other things, hire additional adjudicators to address longer recertification processing times. Specifically, ICE stated that, at present staffing levels, SEVP is able to process 1,939, or 44 percent, of the required annual projected 4,400 recertification cases. ICE’s actions to allocate additional resources to the recertification process are a step in the right direction toward addressing its recertification delays. However, it is unclear whether these actions alone will be adequate to address the delays. As of June 2018, ICE officials told us that there were 3,281 recertification petitions that needed to be adjudicated. As previously discussed, recertification reviews are an important fraud risk control because they are one of ICE’s primary means of reviewing each school’s data and identifying potential school noncompliance and fraud, especially since an out-of-cycle review may not be conducted for each school. As Federal Internal Control Standards state, management should: (1) establish and operate activities to monitor the internal control system and evaluate the results, and (2) identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives. By not requiring schools to submit their petitions within the 180-day period prior to the 2-year expiration date, as required by regulation, ICE has limited assurance it is leveraging the recertification process effectively to identify and respond to potential fraud risks to the program, including those risks associated with allowing a fraudulent school to operate for a longer period. ICE’s plan to increase the number of SEVP adjudicators may help it meet the 2-year recertification requirement, but without monitoring and evaluating the efficacy of these actions, ICE will not have reasonable assurance it can effectively manage the recertification process and associated fraud risks. As previously discussed, ICE’s queue of recertification petitions awaiting adjudication creates additional fraud risks to the program if higher-risk schools continue to operate pending recertification. However, ICE has not assessed the magnitude of such risks. As of June 26, 2018, ICE had 3,281 recertification petitions in a queue for review, according to SEVP officials, petitions that ICE adjudicates in the order in which they were filed. As discussed, ICE uses a variety of mechanisms to monitor schools’ ongoing compliance with program requirements and mitigate fraud risks. In addition, ICE assesses and considers schools’ risks during the adjudication process for recertification. Specifically, according to SEVP’s recertification standard operating procedures, case analysts in the Certification Unit are to review the recertification packages once submitted to determine whether they are complete and prepare them for adjudication. Further, SEVP officials stated that the Certification Unit staff use an assessment of the school’s risk to help prioritize further analysis and review efforts. When adjudicating recertification petitions, adjudicators are to confirm that they have assessed the school’s risk and whether any identified risks have previously led to any further action, according to Certification Unit officials. If case analysts determine that compliance issues are present (e.g., the school has closed or the school has made updates to the Form I-17 that are awaiting adjudication), they are to notify their supervisors. For higher-risk schools, Certification Unit officials stated that adjudicators may request more detailed evidence from schools as part of recertification, consistent with their standard operating procedures, than they would for lower-risk schools to help make more efficient use of the resources in this unit. These processes have helped SEVP consider and address potential risks during the recertification process. However, SEVP has not determined risks posed by schools in its recertification queue and, according to Certification Unit officials, does not prioritize the review of schools’ recertification petitions in its queue based on risk. As previously noted, ICE is required to conduct periodic reviews every 2 years to determine SEVP-certified schools’ continued program eligibility and compliance. The statute governing recertification does not, by its terms, preclude ICE from considering a school’s relative risk as part of the compliance review process. However, SEVP’s Director and Certification Unit officials stated that a recertification process that prioritizes reviews based on school risk would not be particularly helpful or add value in addressing school compliance concerns because the officials already have a number of mechanisms they can use, as previously discussed, to address potential noncompliance, including conducting out-of-cycle reviews of high-risk schools. Although ICE considers schools’ risk-related information during the adjudication process and may identify noncompliant or potentially fraudulent schools through ongoing monitoring activities, ICE has not determined the extent to which there are residual fraud risks posed by schools in the recertification queue that ICE has identified as higher-risk than other schools awaiting recertification. According to GAO’s Fraud Risk Framework, managers should rank residual fraud risks in order of priority, using the likelihood and impact analysis, as well as risk tolerance, to help decide how to allocate resources to respond to residual fraud risks, all of which is documented in a fraud risk profile. As previously discussed, a fraud risk profile (1) identifies the inherent fraud risks affecting the program, (2) assesses the likelihood and effect of each type of fraud risk that it has identified, (3) determines the agency’s tolerance for certain types or levels of fraud risks in the program, and (4) examines the suitability of existing controls for each fraud risk. Given SEVP’s long- standing delays in recertifying schools, without an assessment of residual risks posed by the recertification queue—as part of its fraud risk profile, as previously noted—ICE cannot ensure that it is effectively addressing the risks posed by higher-risk schools awaiting recertification, a situation that does not help further strengthen ICE’s fraud risk-management efforts in SEVP. ICE has identified fraud risks related to DSOs and implemented controls to mitigate these risks, but weaknesses exist in four key areas: (1) verification of information provided by DSOs in support of their eligibility, (2) background checks, (3) mandatory compliance training, and (4) fraud- risk training. Prior to approval of schools’ nomination of individuals to serve as DSOs, these nominees must meet eligibility requirements and pass a criminal-background check, but weaknesses exist in both of these controls. In addition, once ICE approves prospective DSOs, it has controls for oversight and training; however, this training is not mandatory and does not address fraud risks. ICE has eligibility requirements for school employees seeking to serve as DSOs at SEVP-certified schools, as discussed earlier, but does not routinely verify DSO-submitted eligibility information in support of their immigration or citizenship status. According to ICE regulations, to be eligible to participate as a DSO, an individual must be a regularly employed member of the school administration whose office is located at the school and must meet two primary eligibility criteria. First, a DSO’s compensation may not include commissions for recruitment of foreign students. To verify that requirement, a field representative is to interview a school’s principal DSO during an initial certification site visit, and ask whether any prospective DSOs receive compensation from commissions for recruitment of foreign students. In addition, a field representative is to review the school’s website for recruitment-related activities and evaluate the DSO’s job title and position description, according to ICE officials. Second, DSOs must be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, but the Certification Unit does not routinely verify the evidence provided to meet this eligibility requirement. Specifically, DSOs are to submit documentation during the school’s certification or recertification process— such as a passport, birth certificate, Permanent Resident Card or Alien Registration Receipt Card, or copy of naturalization/citizenship certificate—as evidence of their U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent resident status. The Certification Unit is to review this documentation to verify that the biographic details match the information provided on the school’s Form I-17. According to ICE officials, if the Certification Unit suspects that a prospective DSO’s documentation may not be valid, it will send the information to the Compliance Unit for additional review. However, neither the Certification Unit nor the Compliance Unit routinely verify the information reported by DSOs in support of their immigration or citizenship status because they do not have access to the type of information needed to independently verify this information for all prospective DSOs, according to ICE officials. Certification Unit officials told us that verifying information on naturalized U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents would be beneficial. They said that they have previously asked for access to information, such as other DHS databases that contain information on naturalized U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, to strengthen their process for determining the eligibility of prospective DSOs. However, they have yet to receive access to this information. In addition, verifying eligibility information for U.S.-born citizens would also be valuable, but is more difficult than for naturalized U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, according to ICE officials. This is because ICE does not collect DSOs’ Social Security numbers— key information necessary to verify U.S. citizenship—in part because SEVIS does not have the necessary security features needed to collect and house those data, and adding those features would be costly. In June 2018, ICE management officials stated that they were reviewing databases that may be useful to verify DSOs’ self-reported eligibility information but did not provide any additional support or documentation of those plans or a time frame for completing this review. As outlined in our Fraud Risk Framework, as part of an effective antifraud strategy, managers should take steps to verify reported information, particularly self-reported data. Specifically, managers can benefit from conducting data matching to verify key information, including self-reported data and information necessary to determine eligibility, using government or third-party sources to verify data electronically. Until ICE routinely verifies the eligibility information submitted by prospective DSOs in support of their immigration or citizenship status, particularly for naturalized U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, ICE will not be able to ensure that it is preventing ineligible individuals, including those who represent a fraud risk, from becoming DSOs and providing them with access to SEVIS to maintain student records. ICE has taken some initial steps to strengthen the process for vetting prospective DSOs but has not implemented comprehensive background checks on DSO nominees prior to approving them to carry out the DSOs’ reporting, record-keeping, and other functions. ICE officials told us that they have been working since December 2016 to develop a plan to conduct comprehensive background checks on prospective DSOs to address past concerns about DSO vetting. Specifically, in 2011, ICE expressed concerns that DSOs, who were not required to undergo background checks, were responsible for maintaining updated information of foreign students in SEVIS. According to ICE officials, they have taken initial steps to address these concerns by implementing criminal-background checks on prospective DSOs. Specifically, in May 2017, ICE started conducting background checks on all school employees nominated to be DSOs at the time of petitioning for initial SEVP certification or whenever a school requests to add a new DSO. For these types of checks, ICE officials within CTCEU are to review the prospective DSO’s biographic information from both the Form I-17 and the proof of U.S. citizenship or immigration status documentation received by the school. After ICE officials in CTCEU complete this check, they are to forward the findings to SEVP for review. If SEVP determines that a prospective DSO is unsuitable for participation in the program, ICE officials in SEVP are to send a notice of rejection to the nominating school. From April 2017 to March 2018, ICE screened approximately 4,750 prospective DSOs and identified 68 individuals with a criminal history. ICE rejected the nomination of 15 of these prospective DSOs, because, for example, they had criminal histories that included instances of identity theft, fraud in obtaining U.S. citizenship, and conspiracy, among other crimes. ICE officials stated that certain crimes will not necessarily disqualify a candidate, such as misdemeanors, traffic- related infractions, or other lesser crimes. As of June 2018, ICE officials told us that they are developing a more- comprehensive background-check process to screen prospective DSOs against additional government data sources. Specifically, ICE officials told us that they are seeking to partner with DHS’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to collect biometric information (e.g., fingerprints) on prospective DSOs at TSA’s enrollment provider locations nationwide during the school certification process. ICE officials stated that they intend to provide the biometric information they collect through TSA’s enrollment provider to ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), and OPR officials will review such information to determine DSOs’ suitability. According to agency documentation, ICE’s OPR would vet such information against data sources to screen these individuals for prior criminal histories such as sexual misconduct, terrorist activities, and immigration violations. According to ICE officials, they also intend to use this process to periodically review the suitability of incumbent DSOs. While ICE officials have told us they intend to expand the screening of prospective DSOs, ICE does not have a documented implementation plan that outlines how the project will be executed. The Project Management Institute’s A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) identifies standards related to project-management processes, including the need to have documented implementation plans describing how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled, as well as requirements and techniques for communication and establishing agreements among stakeholders. In addition, GAO’s Schedule Assessment Guide identifies best practices associated with developing and maintaining a reliable, high-quality schedule. ICE provided us with a draft of its revised background-check policy, talking points on its plans for these checks, and draft requirements it shared with TSA in December 2016. However, these documents do not provide a detailed project- implementation plan to guide ICE’s effort. As of June 2018, ICE and TSA officials have met twice in the last 2 years, and ICE officials do not have any documents or other written details on their planned coordination with TSA. SEVP’s Director acknowledged that SEVP will need to develop a project plan to help guide its coordination with TSA and ICE’s OPR. Without a documented implementation plan for this effort that outlines how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled, ICE does not have reasonable assurance that it will be able to implement a more- comprehensive DSO background-check process. ICE has established mechanisms for monitoring SEVIS usage by approved DSOs and providing support to DSOs to help them ensure their schools comply with SEVP requirements but does not mandate training for DSOs. Once DSOs are approved by SEVP, they are authorized to make changes to student records in SEVIS and to create Forms I-20, which enable students to apply for nonimmigrant student status. To detect noncompliance and fraud that may be committed by DSOs during this process, ICE has established mechanisms to monitor information entered and identify data for computers used by DSOs through SEVIS compliance checks, among other things. For example, according to agency officials, ICE monitors DSO actions in SEVIS to help prevent noncompliance and fraud. In addition to monitoring DSOs’ use of SEVIS, ICE provides support and training to DSOs to help ensure they can effectively update and maintain student records in SEVIS and provide recommendations to students regarding the maintenance of their status, according to our review of ICE documentation and interviews with ICE and school officials. According to program rules, DSOs are responsible for understanding SEVP regulations related to the requirements for foreign students’ admission, maintenance of status, and change of status and requirements for school approval. To assist them, ICE officials and DSOs that we interviewed told us that SEVP uses its field representatives to provide DSOs with a point of contact for questions related to the program. According to SEVP’s internal guidance, field representatives are expected to visit the schools within their areas of responsibility at least once a year to provide in-person guidance and training to DSOs. DSOs at 15 of the 17 schools we visited stated that the field representatives were helpful, including with providing guidance on how to comply with SEVP rules and regulations. In addition, SEVP internal guidance encourages DSOs to take its web- based training course on the responsibilities and obligations for both DSOs and foreign students in SEVIS. However, this course is voluntary. According to ICE officials and field representatives, the extent to which DSOs take the voluntary training varies—some DSOs receive additional training beyond the voluntary SEVP training, but other DSOs do not complete any training. ICE officials noted that the voluntary online training may be perceived as cumbersome and that, since it is not required, many DSOs instead reach out to field representatives or call the SEVP Response Center to get answers to questions that are covered by existing training materials. ICE officials also stated that they do not know the extent to which DSOs have completed the online training because they do not track this information. Further, the officials acknowledged that since training is voluntary, some DSOs may not complete it before assuming their responsibilities and gaining access to SEVIS. ICE officials we interviewed told us they encounter problems with DSOs complying with record-keeping requirements; however, they believe most of these issues are a result of DSOs not understanding program rules or their own responsibilities within the program. According to agency documentation, in 2014 SEVP found that some DSOs were inconsistently reporting school information in several SEVIS data fields. In addition, SEVP’s Risk Assessment Tool includes a number of high-risk indicators that may stem from DSO record-keeping errors within SEVIS, including students listed as enrolled in an academic program not available at that school (e.g., doctoral students at schools without doctorate degrees available) and students listed as active who have long exceeded their program’s end date or authorized employment’s end date. Errors such as these make it difficult for ICE officials to know whether the information in SEVIS is inaccurate due to unintentional mistakes by the DSO or whether the school or its employees may be engaged in potential fraud. For additional examples of potential noncompliance or fraud, see the box below. Potential Designated School Official Noncompliance or Fraud Student and Exchange Visitor Program officials cited the following examples of potential noncompliance or fraud that they have encountered, among others: the reported foreign-student enrollment listed in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) does not seem to correspond with the number of students attending class or the size of the school’s physical space, all enrolled foreign students listed in SEVIS are living at the same address, and students repeatedly transfer to several different schools. Field representatives at one location we visited noted that DSOs with multiple job responsibilities may not have time to keep up with SEVP rules and policy updates. Similarly, DSOs at 7 of the 17 schools we spoke with mentioned that they have multiple job responsibilities beyond their DSO duties. In addition, SEVP officials indicated that DSOs have a high rate of turnover, especially at small schools, and may lack the expertise to effectively follow program requirements. SEVP officials acknowledged that mandatory training could help reduce the number of unintentional violations by DSOs who may not adequately understand the program’s regulations, thus allowing SEVP staff to focus their monitoring efforts on schools and individuals who may be engaged in intentional noncompliance and fraud. In June 2018, ICE officials told us that they recently received internal agreement to require all new DSOs to complete training prior to gaining full access to SEVIS once the officials release a new version of their DSO training program. However, SEVP officials could not provide documentation on their plans, including time frames for completing the revised DSO-training program, whether to require DSO training, or how they will track DSO compliance. Federal Internal Control Standards calls for agencies to demonstrate a commitment to competence, including recruiting, developing, and retaining competent individuals. Further, it recommends that agencies establish expectations of competence for key roles, including possessing the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities, and training individuals appropriately. Without mandatory training and a process to verify that training is completed, SEVP does not have reasonable assurance that DSOs are familiar with, and understand, their roles and responsibilities as outlined in program regulation. SEVP’s voluntary DSO training emphasizes student and school compliance with program rules and the DSOs’ responsibilities to enter and maintain complete and accurate information in SEVIS in a timely manner but does not address fraud risks to the program, including previously identified fraud schemes or trends. According to ICE officials, some DSOs may receive fraud-specific training from ICE agents through the Project Campus Sentinel initiative; however, these visits are limited to a small portion of certified schools each year. During a Project Campus Sentinel visit, ICE guidance states that an ICE agent will meet with DSOs and provide information on how to detect potential fraud, including student visa exploitation and national security vulnerabilities. In addition, ICE guidance encourages ICE agents to remind DSOs to contact them when they encounter these instances. In fiscal year 2017, ICE officials reported that ICE agents visited 400 of the more than 18,000 SEVP- certified school campuses in existence at that time. According to ICE officials, the agency can only conduct a limited number of Project Campus Sentinel visits to schools each year due to competing investigative priorities. The DSOs we spoke with varied in their understanding of the role they should play in identifying and reporting fraud to SEVP. Specifically, DSOs at 8 of 17 schools told us they did not receive training on SEVP-related fraud risks or could not identify SEVP-provided, fraud-specific training. For example, DSOs at one school told us that there is confusion among DSOs about their role to prevent and report fraud and that this issue has been discussed at past training events and conferences. Specifically, they stated that there is some confusion over the difference between fraud and noncompliance. According to these DSOs, they are responsible for addressing issues of noncompliance, but they do not actively look for SEVP-related fraud. A DSO from another school told us she interprets the DSO role as providing program oversight, including oversight related to fraud, and that she previously reported an instance of potential student fraud to ICE when she encountered suspicious immigration paperwork. In addition, DSOs at another school told us that they were not aware of any training related to fraud risks within SEVP but noted that guidance about fraud trends or potential red-flag indicators could be useful. The Fraud Risk Framework identifies training as one way of demonstrating an agency’s commitment to combating fraud. Training and education intended to increase fraud awareness among stakeholders, managers, and employees serves as a preventive measure to help create a culture of integrity and compliance within the agency. Specifically, the Fraud Risk Framework discusses leading practices for training and education, including communicating responsibilities for implementing fraud controls and details on how and where to report fraud. In addition, increasing awareness of fraud schemes, including red flags and risk indicators, through training and education can serve a preventive purpose by helping create a culture of integrity and compliance within the program and can enable managers, employees, and stakeholders with responsibility for implementing aspects of the program to better detect potential fraud. According to ICE officials, DSOs can serve as the front line against SEVP-related fraud, and they provide a significant portion, if not the majority, of fraud-related tips. In June 2018, ICE officials told us that, in response to discussions that we had during our review, they plan to incorporate fraud training into the revised DSO training. However, because ICE officials just recently made that decision, they had not yet developed documented plans for this training or timelines for when it would be completed. While agreeing to incorporate fraud training into the revised DSO training is a good first step, the development and execution of those plans will be needed to strengthen fraud controls. Until ICE develops and implements a plan for fraud-specific DSO training, ICE will not have reasonable assurance that this training will be delivered and DSOs will have the information they need to address fraud within the program. Through SEVP, ICE oversees over 1.2 million foreign students at nearly 9,000 SEVP-certified schools across more than 18,000 campuses. Past instances of fraud and noncompliance in the program have resulted in ICE taking some steps to address fraud risks in the program, such as developing a Risk Assessment Model and Framework. However, ICE does not have a fraud risk profile that identifies all of SEVP’s fraud risks, discusses the likelihood of those risks, assesses related controls, and identifies the agency’s tolerance for risk. Such a fraud risk profile would help ICE more effectively assess whether additional internal controls or changes to policies or regulations are needed. Moreover, ICE has not yet fully employed the use of data analytics, such as network analysis, to help it identify potentially fraudulent schools before they become certified to enroll foreign students and help it better use its administrative and investigative resources. ICE has also made improvements to its processes for certifying and recertifying SEVP schools and monitoring DSOs—all of which can help reduce the risk of fraud in the program. However, ICE continues to delay the recertification process by initiating the school recertification reviews after the 2-year certification expiration date, which is not consistent with ICE regulations. Further, ICE has not included an assessment of residual risks posed by the current recertification queue—as a part of the fraud risk profile previously noted—and as a result does not have a full understanding of the risks associated with schools awaiting recertification. Although DSOs play an important role in helping ICE oversee students in the program, ICE has recognized they can pose fraud risks to the program. However, ICE does not routinely verify DSO-submitted eligibility information and DSO suitability for participation in SEVP, and therefore does not have reasonable assurance that only eligible and suitable DSOs are participating in the program. Finally, ICE has not developed or implemented mandatory and fraud-specific training to improve DSOs’ compliance with program requirements and aid its efforts to detect fraud in the program. We are making the following seven recommendations to ICE: The Director of ICE should develop a fraud risk profile that aligns with identifies inherent fraud risks affecting the program, assesses the likelihood and impact of inherent fraud risks, determines fraud risk tolerance, and examines the suitability of existing fraud controls and prioritizes residual fraud risks, including residual risks posed by the recertification queue. (Recommendation 1) The Director of ICE should build on existing efforts to use data analytics by employing techniques, such as network analysis, to identify potential fraud indicators in schools petitioning for certification. (Recommendation 2) As ICE works to complete its efforts to hire additional SEVP adjudicators, the Director of ICE should begin notifying certified schools 180 days prior to, and requiring submission of complete recertification petitions by, the 2-year certification expiration date, consistent with regulation, and evaluate whether additional resources are needed. (Recommendation 3) The Director of ICE should, as practicable, verify the eligibility information provided to establish the immigration or citizenship status of lawful permanent residents and naturalized U.S. citizens, as well as U.S.-born citizens, who have been nominated or renominated to serve as DSOs. (Recommendation 4) The Director of ICE should develop an implementation plan for the project aimed at strengthening background checks for DSOs; that plan should outline how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. (Recommendation 5) The Director of ICE should implement mandatory DSO training and verify that the training is completed. (Recommendation 6) The Director of ICE should complete the development and implementation of its plans for mandatory fraud-specific training for DSOs. (Recommendation 7) We provided a draft of this report to DHS for its review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix V, DHS concurred with our recommendations and described specific steps it plans to take in response to all seven of our recommendations. DHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees and the Secretary of Homeland Security. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact Rebecca Shea at (202) 512-6722 or shear@gao.gov or Rebecca Gambler at (202) 512-8777 or gamblerr@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix VI. Table 1 contains information on the eight recommendations that we made to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in our 2012 report, and ICE’s actions to address them. We closed each of these recommendations as implemented. This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued on November 20, 2018, which examined the efforts that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has taken since our 2012 report to address fraud risks, including the extent to which ICE has (1) taken steps to strengthen its management of fraud risks in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), (2) implemented controls to address fraud risks in the school certification and recertification processes, and (3) implemented fraud risk controls related to the eligibility, suitability, and training of Designated School Officials (DSO).The sensitive report included information related to SEVP internal controls used to help prevent and identify noncompliance or fraud in the program. The sensitive report also discussed some planned actions to improve these internal controls, some of which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) deemed to be sensitive and must be protected from public disclosure. This public report omits the information that DHS deemed to be sensitive including details associated with (1) the oversight of schools during the certification and recertification process, (2) our covert testing of SEVP certification internal controls, and (3) current and planned actions to oversee DSOs. Although the information provided in this report is more limited, it addresses the same objectives and uses the same methodology as the sensitive report. For our first objective, to evaluate the extent to which ICE has taken steps to strengthen its management of fraud risks in SEVP, we assessed actions ICE, particularly SEVP and the Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit (CTCEU), have taken since 2012 to design and implement controls to address fraud in the postsecondary, vocational, and English language school certification and recertification process. We reviewed documents including regulations, processes and procedures, and guidance related to fraud risk management, school certification, and recertification processes, and the role of DSOs. We evaluated the extent to which ICE’s practices were consistent with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and GAO’s A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs. In particular, we analyzed ICE documentation, such as standard operating procedures, policy statements, and guidance for adjudicators to determine how ICE’s processes and systems identify and assess risk in SEVP, including the SEVP Risk Assessment Model and Framework, Risk Assessment Tool, Risk Register, and other internal guidance. In addition, we reviewed information from ICE’s current SEVP administrative, watch, and criminal investigative cases and analyzed information on past cases of SEVP fraud, including indictments. Also, we interviewed ICE officials within SEVP to evaluate the extent to which the program has taken steps to strengthen its management of fraud risks since 2012. We met with senior officials from SEVP, including SEVP’s Director and management of the Risk Management Support Team, School Certification Unit (Certification Unit), Analysis and Operations Center (Compliance Unit), Policy Team, and Field Representative Unit. We interviewed officials from ICE’s Office of the Principal Legal Advisor to discuss regulatory priorities and legal authorities related to fraud prevention and detection. We also interviewed officials from ICE’s Identity Benefit Fraud Unit and Domestic Operations to discuss their roles in SEVP-related fraud prevention. In addition, we met with officials from CTCEU headquarters, including the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System Exploitation Section and criminal investigators from 5 of the 26 ICE field offices to discuss past cases of SEVP-related fraud and steps taken to identify and prioritize fraud risk. We visited ICE field offices in Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles and San Francisco, California; Newark, New Jersey; and New York, New York. We selected these locations based on a mix of criteria, including the following characteristics: (1) number of ongoing investigations of certified schools; (2) reported previous and current experience investigating SEVP-related fraud; (3) number of field representatives assigned to or located near the field office; and (4) number of schools that were located proximate to the field office and that were either pending recertification, as of July 2017, or have been recertified since August 2016. As we did not select a probability sample of ICE field offices to interview, the results of these interviews cannot be generalized to all of ICE’s 26 field offices. However, the interviews provided us with perspectives of ICE officials responsible for conducting school fraud investigations, including their views on the process SEVP has established for certifying and monitoring schools, fraud, and national security vulnerabilities related to foreign students, and any challenges field offices have faced in their investigations. We conducted a network analysis utilizing both public and proprietary information associated with currently certified schools to determine the potential to utilize additional data analytics to aid fraud risk-management efforts in SEVP. To develop this analysis, we identified a list of schools that, as of July 2017, had been identified by ICE as either being under active criminal investigation or subject to additional oversight or administrative action due to compliance concerns. We also selected a list of SEVP-certified postsecondary schools without such identified concerns as of September 2017. We restricted our set of schools to those with at least 20 foreign students as of September 2017. In total, 2,439 schools comprising 170 with concerns and 2,269 without such concerns were analyzed. We then used an outside vendor to provide public and proprietary information such as descriptive information associated with these schools including addresses, businesses, and past executives. Using these data, we used network-analysis techniques to identify connections between both those schools with criminal or compliance concerns and schools without such identified concerns. We determined whether each of the postsecondary schools without compliance concerns were linked to any of those with compliance concerns via executive employment. Specifically, we identified instances in which an official associated with a school with criminal or compliance concerns was associated with another school not identified as having those concerns. The underlying logic behind this focus was that schools associated with an official linked to a school of concern may potentially indicate the need for further review of possible criminal or compliance concerns. To further validate this information, we conducted additional research using investigative databases and the Internet to try to verify the instances identified in our analysis such as by ensuring the time frames of the connection appeared relevant or to verify the identity of individuals and schools involved. While such connections are not proof of criminal or compliance problems, they may potentially be indicative of them. This is a diagnostic that has been used in other fraud-related network research. For our second objective, to evaluate the extent to which ICE has implemented controls to address fraud risks in the school certification and recertification processes, we assessed documentation describing SEVP’s school certification and recertification controls, interviewed headquarters and selected field-office ICE officials, and analyzed agency-provided recertification data. Specifically, we assessed SEVP’s standard operating procedures, including its Adjudicator’s Manual, training materials, and other guidance to determine whether the certification and recertification controls described in these documents addressed the high-risk indicators ICE identified in its Risk Assessment Tool. We used this analysis to determine any potential noncompliance and fraud vulnerabilities in these controls. We also assessed SEVP’s controls in these areas against Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government related to risk management, as well as principles of the Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in the Federal Government. Additionally, we interviewed ICE officials in SEVP’s Certification Unit, which is responsible for adjudicating certification and recertification petitions, and the Compliance Unit, which is charged with monitoring schools for ongoing compliance with regulatory record-keeping and reporting requirements. To understand how ICE Homeland Security Investigations agents in the field offices work with officials in SEVP and the CTCEU to investigate school fraud, we conducted semistructured interviews with ICE agents in five field offices. We also interviewed ICE officials from SEVP’s Field Representative Unit as well as eight field representatives assigned to or located near the selected field offices to gather information on the representatives’ roles and activities in identifying and reporting potential school fraud. Further, we conducted covert testing of SEVP’s internal control activities related to the school certification process. Specifically, we submitted certification petitions and conducted other covert investigative work for three fictitious schools, each of which are subject to particular petition requirements. For one of the fictitious schools, we tested SEVP certification controls that require schools to submit complete documentation by submitting a petition for the school that was missing several of the required documents. For our second school, we tested SEVP controls requiring schools to schedule and complete a site visit conducted by an SEVP field representative, by submitting a completed petition for the accredited business school, but avoiding the site visit and requesting that our paperwork move forward without it. For our third fictitious school, we submitted a petition and participated in a site visit with SEVP officials, using a rented space as a fictitious school location. We tested SEVP controls related to verifying petition documentation, and whether SEVP site-visit officials followed established procedures for the site visit. For all three petitions, we used publicly available information to construct our scenarios. We then documented any actions taken by SEVP on the submitted petitions, such as completeness checks, investigative steps, adjudication decisions or requests to provide additional supporting documentation, among other things. Results for all three covert tests, while illustrative, cannot be generalized to the full population of petitions. For our third objective, to determine the extent to which ICE implemented fraud risk controls related to the eligibility and suitability of DSOs, we assessed guidance, training, and policies related to DSOs. Specifically, we reviewed regulations for DSO eligibility and SEVP guidance and standard operating procedures to determine whether supporting evidence provided to meet these requirements is being verified, including the Field Representative Unit’s Site Visit Standard Operation Procedure and the Certification Unit’s Adjudicator’s Manual. We evaluated the extent to which ICE’s practices for verifying eligibility were consistent with the Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in the Federal Government. In addition, we reviewed the current and planned documentation and procedures on ICE’s existing and planned background checks, including the existing documentation for DSO vetting against relevant databases, initial requirements for planned biometric screening, and a draft policy document for the planned checks. To gather additional perspectives, we interviewed ICE officials in headquarters and selected field offices. We also interviewed selected DSOs in the field. We identified leading practices for project planning in the Project Management Institute’s A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge. In addition, we reviewed the best practices associated with developing and maintaining a reliable, high-quality schedule in the GAO Schedule Assessment Guide. In assessing current training and oversight for DSOs, we examined guidance, policies, and procedures for the SEVP Field Representative Unit and CTCEU’s Project Campus Sentinel. We assessed the implementation of these controls against criteria in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs. We reviewed DSO training materials, including the Online Training for DSOs and the Study in the States website. To determine how ICE identifies fraud risk associated with DSOs, the controls in place for addressing and mitigating these risks, and its efforts to identify potential vulnerabilities in its controls, we met with ICE officials at headquarters and five selected field offices, as discussed above. To identify the extent to which they have DSO training and antifraud responsibilities and requirements, we interviewed selected field representatives. Furthermore, we interviewed DSOs at 17 selected certified postsecondary schools on their roles and responsibilities and training resources. We selected these officials because, as of September 2017, they constituted a group of representatives from certified schools of various types and sizes and were located in proximity to our previously selected ICE field-office locations. As we did not select a probability sample of DSOs to interview, the information we obtained from these school officials cannot be generalized. These interviews provided us with the perspectives of DSOs on their roles and responsibilities, training, and fraud risks within the program. Further, we interviewed officials from NAFSA, an association of international educators, to discuss the organization’s views on fraud risks within SEVP, and we reviewed an extract from the NAFSA Advisor’s Manual of federal regulations affecting foreign students and scholars. GAO’s A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs states that, in planning the fraud risk assessment, effective managers tailor the assessment to the program by, among other things, identifying appropriate tools, methods, and sources for gathering information about fraud risks and involving relevant stakeholders in the assessment process (see fig. 11). On the basis of our analysis of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) withdrew certification for approximately 2,600 schools during the period of fiscal years 2013 through 2017 (see fig. 12). The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002 states that a material failure of an SEVP-certified school to comply with the record-keeping and reporting requirements to receive nonimmigrant students shall result in the suspension for at least 1 year, or termination, of the school’s approval to receive such students. Under federal regulation, SEVP can deny an SEVP-certified school’s recertification petition or, as a result of a subsequent out-of-cycle review, can withdraw certification, if the school or its programs are no longer eligible for certification. Denial of recertification or withdrawal on notice as a result of out-of-cycle review may be for any valid and substantive reason, including failure to comply with record-keeping and reporting requirements, willful issuance by a DSO of a false statement, or not operating as a legitimate institution, among other bases. According to SEVP officials, denials resulting from recertification reviews are often based on historical discrepancies in the DSO’s data entry, record-maintenance and Form I-20 issuance issues, or a negative change in the school’s operating status, such as a loss of state licensure. By regulation, an appeal of a notice of denial or withdrawal must be made within 15 days after service of the decision. Schools denied recertification must, according to regulations, wait at least 1 calendar year from the date of denial of recertification or withdrawal notice before being eligible to petition again for certification. If, upon the completion of an out-of-cycle review, SEVP determines that a school has failed to sustain eligibility or has failed to comply with the record-keeping, retention, reporting, or other requirements, SEVP will institute withdrawal proceedings by serving the school a notice of intent to withdraw SEVP certification. Failure of a school to respond to a notice of intent to withdraw within 30 days will result in an unappealable withdrawal of the school’s certification. At the conclusion of withdrawal proceedings, a school found to be ineligible for continued SEVP certification as a result of an out-of-cycle review will receive a notice of withdrawal. SEVP withdrew on notice approximately 211 certifications from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 (see fig. 12). If SEVP staff identify an issue during an out- of-cycle review that seems to be an error not warranting withdrawal, SEVP could issue a Remedial Action Plan to the school describing the issues it needs to address to retain its program eligibility. According to SEVP officials, once they have gathered enough evidence and made the decision to withdraw the school’s certification, SEVP can temporarily terminate the school’s ability to issue Forms I-20 to students. For example, SEVP officials explained that if a school that is otherwise in compliance lets its accreditation lapse, SEVP may revoke its authority to issue Forms I-20 until it renews its accreditation. Regarding automatic withdrawals, SEVP will serve a notice of intent to withdraw SEVP certification to the school 30 days prior to its certification expiration date if, up until that point the school has failed to file a complete petition for recertification. From fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2017, SEVP automatically withdrew 1,763 certifications (see fig. 12). SEVP will not accept a petition for recertification and the school will be automatically withdrawn immediately if such school has effectively relinquished its SEVP certification by not petitioning for recertification, abandoning its petition, or not submitting a complete recertification package by the certification expiration date. Certified schools can also voluntarily withdraw their certification at any time. In addition to the contacts named above, Latesha Love (Assistant Director), Kathryn Bernet (Assistant Director), Nick Weeks (Analyst-in- Charge), David Aja, David Dornisch, Gabrielle Fagan, April Gamble, Gina Hoover, Lauren Kirkpatrick, Kirsten Lauber, Barbara Lewis, Sasan J. “Jon” Najmi, Robin Nye, George Ogilvie, Ramon Rodriguez, Constance Satchell, Sabrina Streagle, Shana Wallace, and Helina Wong made key contributions to this report.\n","  13  Zika is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito but can also be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or from person to person through sexual contact or blood transfusion. The disease can cause symptoms that include fever, rash, conjunctivitis (“pink eye” where the eyes appear red or pink), and joint and muscle pain. Although most people with Zika have only mild symptoms or none at all, Zika in pregnant women has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as miscarriage and stillbirth, and severe birth defects. Zika can be passed to the fetus and cause a birth defect of the brain called microcephaly and other severe brain defects, according to CDC. Zika is also linked to other problems such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, an uncommon condition of the nervous system. Although at present no vaccine has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to prevent Zika, several vaccines are in different phases of development. Zika was first identified in the Zika Forest in Uganda in 1947 and caused only sporadic human disease until 2007. In 2007, Zika was detected in Yap State, Federated States of Micronesia, and subsequent outbreaks occurred in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. In 2014, Zika spread east across the Pacific Ocean to French Polynesia, then to Easter Island. In May 2015, Brazil documented the first case of locally acquired Zika transmission in the Americas. See figure 1 for a timeline of the Zika outbreak and the U.S. Zika response overseas. According to WHO, in November 2015, Suriname, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, and Venezuela reported cases of locally acquired Zika, followed by Panama, Honduras, French Guiana, Martinique, and Puerto Rico in December 2015. Zika continued to spread throughout the region, and on February 1, 2016, WHO declared that the recent association of Zika with clusters of microcephaly and other neurological disorders constituted a public health emergency of international concern. In November 2016, WHO declared an end of the public health emergency of international concern regarding microcephaly, other neurological disorders, and Zika. However, WHO announced that Zika and the associated health outcomes remained a significant public health challenge requiring intense action. Zika spread to multiple countries throughout the globe but primarily affected countries in Latin America and the Caribbean region. According to WHO, as of March 2017, transmission of the Zika virus was occurring in 79 countries or territories, most of which are located in the Western Hemisphere. According to WHO, from 2015 to 2017, there were approximately 583,000 suspected and 223,000 confirmed cases of Zika virus transmission in the Western Hemisphere. See figure 2 for the cumulative Zika incidence rates in each country in Latin America and the Caribbean from 2015 to 2017. In February 2016, the President submitted a request to Congress for emergency funding to enhance ongoing U.S. efforts to prepare for and respond to Zika, including a request for funding for USAID and State to respond to the outbreak overseas. In addition, in April 2016, USAID and State notified Congress of their intent to repurpose $215 million of fiscal year 2015 supplemental Economic Support Fund Ebola funding for the U.S. Zika response overseas, which included $78 million for CDC international Zika activities. In September 2016, Congress appropriated about $175.1 million in supplemental funding to USAID and State in the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, for the U.S. Zika response overseas. USAID activities initially began in five countries—Haiti, Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Dominican Republic—based on an assessment of their Zika risk and limited host government capacity to prevent the spread and respond to the impact of the virus. USAID ultimately supported activities in 26 countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region. As of September 30, 2018, USAID and State had obligated about $385 million (99 percent) of the total $390 million available for the U.S. Zika response overseas and had disbursed approximately $264 million (68 percent). Specifically, USAID had obligated all of its funds available for the Zika response and disbursed about two-thirds, and State had obligated and disbursed more than three-quarters of its funding for Zika. USAID and State had disbursed a higher proportion of the repurposed Ebola funds than the funds appropriated in the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016. See figure 3 for USAID and State Zika response funding appropriations, obligations, and disbursements as of September 30, 2018. Of the $215 million in repurposed Ebola funds, USAID and State had obligated $215 million (100 percent) and had disbursed almost $201 million (93 percent) as of September 30, 2018. Of the approximately $175 million appropriated in the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, USAID and State had obligated about $170 million (about 97 percent) and had disbursed about $63 million (36 percent) as of September 30, 2018. As of September 30, 2018, USAID had obligated all funds available for the Zika response and had disbursed about two-thirds, from three accounts. USAID has two sources of funding for Zika response activities: $211 million of fiscal year 2015 supplemental Economic Support Fund Ebola funding repurposed for the Zika response and about $155.5 million provided in the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016—including $145.5 million and $10.0 million through the Global Health Programs and Operating Expenses accounts, respectively—for a total of $366.5 million. As of September 30, 2018, USAID had obligated approximately $366.5 million (100 percent) and had disbursed approximately $245 million (67 percent), from the Economic Support Fund, Global Health Programs, and Operating Expenses appropriations accounts. See figure 4 for USAID Zika response funding obligations and disbursements by account. USAID obligated all funding for Zika response activities within a year after it was repurposed or appropriated. As of September 30, 2018, USAID had disbursed a higher proportion of repurposed fiscal year 2015 supplemental Economic Support Fund Ebola funding (93 percent) compared with Global Health Programs and Operating Expenses funding (28 percent and 72 percent, respectively), which was appropriated in the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, in September 2016. The $211 million in Economic Support Fund obligations supported 56 USAID activities, as well as a $78 million interagency transfer to CDC. The $145.5 million in Global Health Programs obligations supported 25 activities and program support. Obligations for USAID-supported activities ranged from $12,000 to $37 million and included support for activities such as the procurement of insect repellent to assist pregnant women in avoiding Zika infection and strengthening the ability of civil society and community networks to disseminate information related to Zika. CDC supported 25 activities that ranged from $276,000 to $13.6 million, including activities such as collecting and analyzing public health data, conducting epidemiological studies to better understand the prevalence of Zika and related risk factors, building laboratory capacity, and providing training to conduct Zika virus testing. As of September 30, 2018, State had obligated and disbursed more than three-quarters of funding available for the Zika response, from two accounts. State has two sources of funding for Zika response activities: $4 million from a fiscal year 2015 supplemental Economic Support Fund appropriation for the Ebola response that was repurposed for the Zika response and about $19.6 million provided in the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, the majority of which was provided through the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account, for a total of about $23.6 million. As of September 30, 2018, State had obligated and disbursed about $18.3 million (almost 78 percent) from the Economic Support Fund and Diplomatic and Consular Programs accounts. See figure 5 for State Zika response funding obligations and disbursements by account. Under the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, State was provided almost $14.6 million through the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account, $4 million through the Emergencies in Diplomatic and Consular Services account, and $1 million through the Repatriation Loans Program account, for a total of almost $19.6 million. In September 2017, State notified Congress of its intent to transfer the $4 million from the Emergencies in Diplomatic and Consular Services account and $870,000 from the Repatriation Loans Program account to the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account. These transfers resulted in a total of $19.5 million available under the Diplomatic and Consular Programs account and $130,000 under the Repatriation Loans Program account. The $4 million in Economic Support Fund obligations supported research and development activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency to control disease-carrying mosquito populations. The $14.3 million in Diplomatic and Consular Programs obligations supported activities including medical evacuations to protect the health of pregnant U.S. government personnel and eligible family members, mosquito abatement training and other measures to reduce Zika risk to overseas staff, as well as public diplomacy efforts to further inform journalists and the public about the U.S. response to Zika. In their reporting to Congress on the uses of Zika funds, USAID and State included some country information but did not track or provide information on funding uses broken down on a country basis. In October 2016, USAID and State submitted a consolidated report to the appropriations committees on the anticipated uses of funds made available to USAID and State by the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, in response to a reporting requirement in Section 203 of the act. After the initial submission, the act required the agencies to update and submit the report to the committees on appropriations every 60 days until September 30, 2017. The initial report described ongoing Zika response activities in five countries as well as planned activities in additional countries. Subsequent reports listed specific countries where USAID and State supported Zika response activities. However, USAID and State did not provide information to Congress on the uses of funding appropriated by the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, broken down by country. The reports also included obligation and disbursement information for the fiscal year 2015 supplemental Economic Support Fund Ebola funding that was repurposed for the international Zika response; however, similar to the information provided regarding the funds appropriated by the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, the reports’ information on the use of the repurposed Ebola funds was also not broken down by country. USAID officials told us that Zika activities were designed to be implemented on a regional and multicountry basis. While over 95 percent of all U.S. government funds available for the Zika response overseas were obligated by USAID, and the agency had a number of financial tracking systems in place, the agency did not take steps to record its funding by country at the outset of Zika response programming. Specifically, USAID officials noted that the contracts and grants the agency had signed with its implementing partners did not include provisions requiring partners to provide information to USAID that broke down their use of funds by country. Consequently, USAID was unable to track the uses of Zika funds on a country basis. Federal internal control standards state that management should use and communicate the necessary quality information both internally and externally to achieve the entity’s objectives and address related risks. According to USAID officials, tracking information on the uses of Zika response funding broken down by country would be helpful in the future for mission directors, chiefs of missions, and partner-country ministries of health, some of whom have requested this information. Moreover, data on USAID funding to address future infectious disease outbreaks if broken down by uses in each country could provide additional useful information to decision makers in assessing risks and planning responses. The ability to compile funding by country when responding to future infectious disease outbreaks would enable USAID to provide key decision makers, including Congress and agency officials, with additional information to better support spending oversight and inform budgetary and planning decisions. As part of the U.S. Zika response overseas, USAID provided assistance to several countries in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America and conducted a variety of activities related to mosquito control, public awareness, capacity building, and research. In support of mosquito control, USAID’s Zika AIRS Project (ZAP) conducted activities that included Entomological monitoring: collecting and reporting information on the location and population of mosquitoes; Larviciding: placing agents that kill mosquito eggs in likely breeding sites, such as water receptacles; Source reduction interventions: facilitating the removal or mitigation of likely breeding sites, such as tires, pots, barrels, or anything that may allow for standing water; and Indoor residual spraying: spraying insecticide that has a lasting effect in houses. We observed mosquito control activities during our fieldwork. For example, in Honduras we followed a team as they went house to house to implement and facilitate mosquito control activities. They collected information from mosquito egg traps, which serve as indicator of breeding activity, and recorded it for monitoring purposes. They also examined the premises for potential mosquito breeding sites, treated susceptible areas such as wash basins with larvicide, and spoke with residents about picking up trash and covering outdoor plant pots to reduce potential breeding sites. To support raising public awareness of the risk of Zika virus and to promote behavior change to reduce the spread of the disease, USAID implementing partners such as the Red Cross and CARE told us that they collaborated with communities, local government, and schools to communicate information about Zika. For example, in Trinidad, the Red Cross conducted educational campaigns at schools to improve students’ awareness. During our fieldwork, we observed a session led by adult volunteers during which children played games and engaged in discussions designed to teach Zika prevention and response methods. Implementing partners told us that the impact of such efforts extends beyond those reached directly; for example, they said the children who learned about Zika risks and prevention also conveyed the knowledge to their families, who in turn may pass it on to friends or others in the community. In Peru, CARE worked with schools to develop written education guides for application in the classroom and conducted communication campaigns. During our fieldwork, we went to schools and observed students delivering oral presentations on Zika risks and prevention. In addition, we witnessed other student activities, such as classroom discussions and art projects focused on Zika, designed to demonstrate understanding, raise awareness, and promote behavior change. To support capacity building, the Applying Science to Strengthen and Improve Systems (ASSIST) activity, which USAID funding supported, focused on improving Zika-related health services. Specific efforts included conducting a baseline assessment of the quality of care, improving clinical guidelines, training health care providers, and implementing a quality improvement program. During our fieldwork in Honduras, we visited a hospital and met with ASSIST-supported health workers who told us that they applied new guidance in their practice, and as a result, improved care in areas including counseling, screening, diagnosis, and follow-up of those affected by Zika. We also visited a hospital in Dominican Republic, where health care workers stated that they collaborated with ASSIST in responding to Zika by training staff and producing guidance materials. These activities raised awareness, increased prevention efforts, and improved care, according to health care workers. USAID supported research, training, and innovation activities through its “Grand Challenge” program as well as its interagency agreement with CDC. USAID launched a series of Grand Challenge efforts, providing $30 million in grants to foster innovation on new methods and technologies to respond to Zika. One grant, for example, supported the World Mosquito Program’s research into the feasibility and effectiveness of infecting mosquitoes with bacteria to hinder transmission of the Zika virus. We visited the program’s operations in Colombia, met with scientists, and observed the breeding lab. Program scientists told us that initial efforts have been promising and that if more tests prove successful, the potential for reducing Zika transmission could be significant. Another USAID Grand Challenge grant supports research into the possible use of genetically modified yeast to prevent mosquito eggs from hatching. We spoke with scientists, lab technicians, and viewed facilities supported by this grant in Trinidad during our field work. Scientists stated that yeast attracts mosquitoes and is inexpensive, commonly available, and environmentally friendly. Testing is ongoing, but if successful, the approach could help reduce populations of mosquitoes in critical areas, according to the scientists. The USAID–CDC interagency agreement identifies a range of activities that involve technical assistance to help strengthen surveillance, emergency operations and management, and epidemiological investigations and research. One CDC activity, for example, focuses on supporting public health surveillance and epidemiological studies to better understand the prevalence and risk factors for severe health outcomes related to Zika. Another activity aims to build laboratory capacity in areas such as Zika diagnostic test production and distribution. In addition, the objectives of CDC’s Field Epidemiology Training Program are to train qualified professionals, build sustainable capacity for detecting and responding to health threats, and develop in-country expertise so that disease outbreaks can be detected locally and prevented from spreading. In Dominican Republic, CDC officials told us that this program delivers 3 months of classroom and field project training, and that as of August 2018, four cohorts of approximately 80 students each had completed the training. CDC officials told us that in addition to implementing various activities, CDC’s Central America Regional Office in Guatemala played an important role in facilitating U.S. government cooperation with Colombia, which had the second largest outbreak of Zika after Brazil. We reviewed status reports for six USAID activities that received among the highest amounts of funding, and each identified various results. Below, we describe the activities and examples of reported results. For more information, see appendix II. ASSIST: This activity sought to strengthen Zika-related health services and systems in Latin America and the Caribbean with a focus on pregnant women, newborns, and women of reproductive age. ASSIST reported that it conducted virtual and in-person training, courses, and workshops on Zika prevention, diagnosis, and care. ASSIST also reported that 8,133 health care workers had been trained as of March 2017, and that its efforts had supported the development of Zika care protocols and guidelines with a new emphasis on clinical care and support for affected infants and families. ASSIST further reported that through March 2018, 75 percent of children affected by Zika in Dominican Republic received specialized care at Hospital Infantil Robert Reid Cabral, an ASSIST- supported hospital in the capital, Santo Domingo. Red Cross: This activity aimed to reduce risks associated with Zika infection through community involvement, sharing lessons learned, and improving practices. The Red Cross reported that its communication efforts reached approximately 3,000 students, 29 communities, and almost 140,000 people via TV, radio, and social media engagement, providing them with information on risk and protection methods. Zika AIRS Project (ZAP): This is a mosquito control activity focused on reducing Zika transmission in Latin America and the Caribbean. Specific activities supported by USAID funding included entomological monitoring, larviciding, source reduction interventions, and indoor residual spraying. ZAP reported that five countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, and Jamaica) implemented comprehensive mosquito control activities. Population Services International: The purpose of this activity was to improve the capacity and raise awareness of people in countries affected by and at risk of Zika and other vector-borne diseases. Population Services International reported that through March 2018, 35 health providers in Dominican Republic, El Salvador, and Guatemala had been trained in raising awareness about Zika prevention and the use of printed educational materials. In addition, 1,006 pregnant women received counseling on Zika prevention, and 967 received prevention kits containing condoms, mosquito repellent, and printed educational materials. Additionally, 227 pharmacy attendants from 195 pharmacies received information on Zika prevention. Save the Children’s Community Action on Zika (CAZ): The goal of this project was to reduce Zika transmission and minimize the risk of Zika-related microcephaly and other neurological disorders. The project focused on helping the most vulnerable through community- based prevention strategies in Colombia, Dominican Republic, and three Central American countries. CAZ reported that it had reached approximately 65,000 students and trained 3,838 community agents and volunteers who supported efforts to strengthen the capacity to prevent Zika in 921 communities. United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF): This activity focused primarily on four countries: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Dominican Republic. UNICEF worked to promote the adoption of prevention behaviors among at-risk populations through actions to raise awareness at multiple levels: individual, interpersonal, community, institutional, and national policy levels. UNICEF reported that these efforts reached more than 5.5 million people with key risk- communication messages and more than 150,000 people through coordinated social mobilization and person-to-person communication. For example, in Guatemala, UNICEF worked with a local partner to train young people and adolescents in schools and social groups to lead prevention activities in their communities. Moreover, around 25,000 pregnant women benefited from counseling sessions on Zika- prevention behaviors. In response to Zika, State conducted public awareness and communication initiatives, medical evacuations for overseas staff, and other activities. According to a State official, State conducted Zika-related public outreach to U.S. citizens abroad through social media and the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, a service that provides information from U.S. embassies about local safety conditions. According to a State official, State also implemented public diplomacy activities related to Zika awareness and communication. For example, one activity aimed to raise awareness of vector-borne diseases such as Zika and collect information on insect breeding grounds. Another supported the addition of a science envoy who focused specifically on Zika and mosquito-borne diseases. In addition, according to a State official, State conducted Zika-related medical evacuations as part of those normally offered to female staff who became pregnant while serving abroad. State’s medical services division also supported overseas posts by purchasing and distributing mosquito repellent. State officials also told us that they coordinated Zika response efforts internally and externally. For example, State participated in a U.S. government interagency group led by CDC to exchange information on Zika and coordinated with other agencies on the response effort. Over the course of our fieldwork, USAID and implementing partner officials identified two key challenges to the implementation of Zika response activities. The first was the long-term sustainability of Zika response activities. The second was the timely implementation of Zika response activities in countries without bilateral USAID health programs. While USAID took steps to address the challenge related to sustainability, it only partially mitigated the challenge to timely implementation of Zika response activities in countries without bilateral USAID health programs. Agency and implementing partner officials identified the sustainability of Zika response efforts as a key challenge. While USAID did not intend to continue U.S. Zika response activities after the one-time emergency funding, sustainability was a consideration and posed a challenge due to the short implementation time frame, according to agency and implementing partner officials. One official further elaborated that Zika funding efforts occurred during the acute phase of the outbreak, which made it difficult to focus on long-term needs. For example, an implementing partner said that Zika-affected children require long-term care that host country governments may not be able to support after U.S. assistance ends. In addition, host country government officials, U.S. government officials, and implementing partners said that some Zika activities may not be sustainable after U.S. assistance is finished due to a lack of funds and limited capacity to continue the work. To address this challenge and support the long-term continuation of Zika response activities, implementing partners aligned their activities with those of host country governments and other organizations. Implementing partners reported working with governments and other organizations to incorporate Zika activities into their plans and practices so they could continue over the long term. One implementing partner and the Dominican Republic’s Ministry of Health, for example, planned mosquito control efforts together, and a Ministry of Health official said they intend to continue those control efforts after the end of Zika funding. Implementing partners in various countries also stated that Zika activities brought broader benefits to mosquito control, disability services, maternal health care, surveillance efforts, and emergency preparedness, which facilitated partners’ efforts to align their Zika response activities. For example, an implementing partner reported using Zika funding to develop organizational guidelines for treating Zika-affected children, which will be used by the health care system in Dominican Republic to treat children with related disabilities in the long term. According to some implementing partners in countries we visited, they developed Zika protocols and guidelines in response to new scientific information, trained government and other personnel on the protocols, and worked with officials of host country governments and other organizations to encourage adoption of Zika activities. For example, according to an agency official, an implementing partner in Peru developed a curriculum for epidemiologists and trained them on how to detect and contain mosquito-borne diseases, such as Zika. The agency official said that the implementing partner shared the training curriculum and materials with Peru’s Ministry of Health so it could continue the trainings after the end of Zika funding. According to implementing partners, they also involved local communities in activities to increase community ownership and address sustainability. For example, an implementing partner official said they trained a cadre of community volunteers in Guatemala and El Salvador on behavior change practices so that they can continue activities after the end of Zika funding. In addition, implementing partner officials said that engaging with communities to learn about needs and resources is important to continued community interest in activities. For example, an implementing partner that works with communities on health priorities developed an approach that includes a toolkit for identifying a community’s specific risks for Zika and the efforts best suited to helping the community eradicate mosquito breeding sites. In places affected by violence, some implementing partners engaged with communities to better understand how to prioritize community worker and volunteer safety to enable the continuation of activities. For example, an implementing partner in Guatemala engaged with local communities to understand areas they recommended health workers avoid due to safety concerns. Agency and implementing partner officials described timely implementation of activities in some countries without bilateral USAID health programs as a second key challenge. Twenty-two out of the 26 countries where USAID implemented its Zika response activities were countries without bilateral USAID health programs. USAID officials stated that, as a result, there were no USAID health program officials present in these countries to build on relationships with host country health officials and help facilitate the start of implementing partners’ activities during the Zika response. USAID officials noted two reasons that working with host country governments took time. First, some U.S. Zika response activities started after a decline in Zika cases, when some host country governments were no longer as focused on countering the disease. Implementing partners responded to this situation by identifying related health service improvements that could stem from implementing a Zika response and were of interest to the host country governments. Second, agency and implementing partner officials said that in some countries without bilateral USAID health programs it also took time to identify the appropriate points of contact and establish relationships—preliminary steps needed to obtain approval from the host country government before activities could get underway. According to USAID officials, these relationships are critical to navigating bureaucratic systems and assist in designing activities that meet the needs of host country governments and communities, which are needed for timely implementation. USAID took some steps to address the timely implementation challenge in countries without bilateral health programs. For example, according to USAID officials, USAID worked with multilateral partners that had a health presence in those countries and relied on regional field-based Zika coordinators to build relationships with in-country points of contact. As noted above, however, agency officials indicated that Zika response activities took additional time to deploy in some of the countries without bilateral USAID health programs. Further, implementing partners reported it took additional time to start up activities in those countries because of the time it took to obtain approval for them from the ministries of health. For example, one implementing partner reported that activity startup was postponed for nearly 3 months until it received approval from the host country government. Another implementing partner said it was a challenge to get information on Zika from the host country government or establish dialogue until USAID officials became involved. USAID officials also said that efforts to start and integrate Zika response activities in countries with ongoing USAID health programs did not face a number of the obstacles to timely implementation experienced in countries without bilateral USAID health programs. According to federal internal control standards, agencies should design control activities, such as a plan, to achieve their objectives and address related risks, such as the challenge related to timely implementation. In an effort to enhance its planning for outbreaks, USAID developed an infectious disease response plan in July 2018 during the time frame of our review. However, the plan does not provide specific guidance on how to address the challenge of initiating emergency response activities in countries without bilateral USAID health programs, such as by noting particular practices that implementing partners and other officials can use to address that challenge. For example, our fieldwork and interviews with USAID officials indicate that the following may be helpful practices for infectious disease response: Immediately establish an in-country working group that includes implementing partners, host country government officials, and U.S. government officials to help initiate and coordinate outbreak response. Communicate a current list of health ministry and other relevant government officials to implementing partners and other officials so they can quickly identify the appropriate points of contact. According to USAID officials, USAID missions maintain regular contact with host country governments, maintain contact lists, and participate in coordination meetings. However, in the case of overseas Zika response, some implementing partner officials in the field told us that they did not initially know who to contact in the host country government. Likewise, a host country government official told us that a working group on Zika outbreak response was not established until after officials recognized that implementing partner and host country government officials did not have regular channels of communication. By taking steps to improve planning for countries without bilateral USAID health programs—such as by adding specific guidance for initiating emergency response activities in such countries to its July 2018 plan—USAID would be better positioned to quickly build relationships with health ministry and other key government officials in host countries and thus be better able to provide a timely infectious disease response to future outbreaks. The Zika virus quickly spread to dozens of countries in 2015 and 2016, prompting WHO to declare the virus and associated health risks an international public health emergency. As future infectious disease outbreaks arise, Congress will be called on to fund overseas response efforts, as it did with the Zika outbreak, and USAID is likely once again to play a vital role in those efforts. Because USAID did not provide key decision makers with information on how Zika funding was distributed across the various countries where it conducted response activities, decision makers lack visibility into a key aspect of the overall U.S. Zika response overseas. The ability to compile this information by country when responding to future infectious disease outbreaks would enable USAID to provide key decision makers, including Congress and agency officials, with additional information to better support spending oversight and inform budgetary and planning decisions. Further, while USAID took steps to address the challenge of sustaining Zika response activities over the long term, it did not fully mitigate the challenge of timely implementation of activities in countries without bilateral USAID health programs. As a result, the agency’s response to Zika took additional time in some countries without bilateral USAID health programs. Infectious disease response planning that addresses countries without bilateral USAID health programs would better position USAID to quickly respond to infectious disease outbreaks, such as Zika, whenever the need arises. We are making the following two recommendations to USAID: The Administrator of USAID should take steps to ensure that, in responding to future public health emergencies of international concern, the agency is able to compile funding information broken down by country. (Recommendation 1) The Administrator of USAID should take steps to improve its infectious disease response planning to address the challenge of initiating response activities in countries without bilateral USAID health programs in a timely manner. (Recommendation 2) We provided a draft of this report to USAID, State, and CDC for review and comment. USAID provided written comments, which we have reproduced in appendix III. In its comments, USAID agreed with our findings and recommendations and identified a number of actions it plans to take in response. Specifically, USAID stated that in responding to future public health emergencies of international concern, it plans to compile and report on funding by country. USAID also outlined the steps it plans to take to develop additional guidance for USAID officials in countries without bilateral health programs. State and CDC did not provide formal responses. CDC provided technical comments, which we incorporated throughout the report, as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Administrator of USAID, the Secretaries of State and of Health and Human Services, and to other interested parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-3149 or gootnickd@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix IV. The Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, included a provision for us to review the status of U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and Department of State (State) actions to respond to Zika. In this report, we examine (1) the status of USAID and State funding for the U.S. Zika response overseas, (2) activities supported by these funds, and (3) challenges, if any, to implementing Zika response activities and actions taken to address any challenges. To examine the status of funding for U.S. Zika response overseas, we reviewed USAID and State’s reports to the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations mandated by Section 203 of the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016. We reviewed agency reporting submitted to Congress and discussed the reports with agency officials. We also reviewed USAID and State’s reports to the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations mandated by the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2015. We obtained additional funding and activity information from USAID covering a period beyond that included in the reports to Congress. We reviewed the interagency agreement between USAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), outlining the CDC’s Zika response activities supported by $78 million in funds USAID obligated to CDC. We also obtained additional funding data from CDC and interviewed CDC officials to discuss the status of the agencies’ obligations and disbursements for Zika response activities. We analyzed USAID’s and State’s obligations and disbursements that the agencies reported as supporting the U.S. Zika response overseas, as of September 30, 2018. We analyzed agency obligations and disbursements across agency bureaus, funding accounts, and activities for the Zika response. Additionally, we interviewed officials from USAID and State to discuss the agencies’ obligations and disbursements for Zika response activities. We then reviewed the funding data and related documentation and consulted with USAID and State officials on the accuracy and completeness of the data. In the small number of instances where we identified potential issues or inconsistencies in the data, we contacted relevant agency officials and obtained information from them necessary to resolve the discrepancies. We assessed USAID’s tracking of funding data against federal internal control standards related to using quality information. We also utilized information from data reliability assessments for two recent GAO reports that utilized funding data from the same USAID and State systems. We determined that the data we used were sufficiently reliable for our purposes of examining USAID’s and State’s obligations and disbursements of the funds. To examine activities that USAID and State implemented in response to Zika overseas, we conducted fieldwork, analyzed agency documents, and interviewed officials. We examined the status and progress related to Zika response activities. We conducted a teleconference with officials in Haiti and El Salvador and conducted fieldwork in Barbados, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago. We selected these countries based on the following criteria: (1) geographic diversity to include the Caribbean, Central America, and South America; (2) coverage of the main lines of effort (mosquito control, public awareness, capacity building, and research); and (3) the presence of activities under way that accounted for a significant portion of funding. During our fieldwork, we interviewed agency officials who played a role in Zika response activities, which included officials from State, USAID, and CDC. We also interviewed host government officials, implementing partners, health care workers, community volunteers, and researchers. In addition, we visited offices, toured facilities, and observed operations. We also attended a conference in Guatemala that addressed topics including status, successes, challenges, and lessons learned related to USAID’s Zika response. We reviewed agency documents describing the plans and goals of activities. We also analyzed progress reports of six activities to provide illustrative examples of results. We selected activities from those with among with the highest amounts of funding and that together represented approximately 33 percent of all USAID funding for Zika response and a range of countries, lines of effort, and types of implementing partners (such as nongovernmental organizations and international organizations). The sample is not generalizable to all of USAID’s Zika response activities. To examine challenges, if any, to implementing Zika response activities and actions taken to address any challenges, we interviewed U.S. government officials, USAID implementing partners, and host government officials, and we analyzed progress reports from selected USAID-funded Zika response activities. We identified key challenges based on the nature of the description and the degree to which a diversity of interviewees and documents made mention of them. We reviewed USAID policy, USAID’s infectious disease response plan, federal internal controls, implementing partner progress reports, and interviews with officials to determine what agencies did to address these challenges. We assessed USAID’s infectious disease response plan against relevant federal internal control standards. We conducted this performance audit from December 2017 to May 2019 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate, evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. To provide illustrative examples of the results of Zika response activities funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), we analyzed implementing partners’ progress reports for a sample of six activities. We selected activities from those with among the highest amounts of funding and that together represented approximately 33 percent of all USAID funding for Zika response and a range of countries, lines of effort, and types of implementing partners (such as nongovernmental organizations and international organizations). Quantitative figures related to individual indicators listed below reflect the targeted population of the activity. Start dates and funding information provided below reflect the date of the report to Congress in which the activity first appeared and the associated funds obligated. The sample is not generalizable to all USAID’s Zika response activities. Table 1 presents the progress on key indicators as of March 2018 reported to USAID by the Applying Science to Strengthen and Improve Systems activity. The aim of the activity was to strengthen Zika-related health services and systems in Latin America and the Caribbean with a focus on pregnant women, newborns, and women of reproductive age.

The report found that nearly 10 percent of interviewees shared circumstances of involuntary work and coercion that, taken together, constituted forced labor. The report concluded that if its selection of interviewees is representative of workers employed across the Thai seafood industry, it would indicate that tens of thousands of workers in Thai fishing and seafood processing are working in forced labor conditions. Fishing activities are vulnerable to a number of illicit practices, including illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and forced labor. IUU fishing is a broad term that includes a variety of fishing activities with social, economic, and environmental impacts and concerns all aspects and stages of the capture and marketing of fish, according to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. Examples of IUU activities include fishing without a license or in excess of quota for certain species; failing to report catches or making false reports on catches; and conducting unauthorized transshipments, such as transfers of fish to cargo vessels at sea or port, according to NOAA. IUU fishing poses a threat to food security and socioeconomic stability in many parts of the world, according to NOAA documents, and many crew members on fishing vessels that engage in IUU fishing are from poor or underdeveloped areas. In addition, the Food and Agriculture Organization has noted that activities of those engaging in IUU fishing can constitute, lead to, or be associated with organized crime or other crimes, such as human trafficking, that may include forced labor. The International Labor Organization—an agency within the United Nations that, among other things, sets labor standards—has identified common indicators of forced labor in any work sector, as shown in figure 1. The presence of a single indicator in a given situation may, in some cases, indicate the existence of forced labor; in other cases, several indicators taken together may point to forced labor, according to an International Labor Organization document. Forced labor can occur at various points along the seafood supply chain—which can be long and complex—with limited visibility at various points, making it difficult to detect (see fig. 2). For example, forced labor may occur if workers are held on fishing vessels for long durations without adequate breaks or the ability to return to land. It may also occur in later stages of seafood processing, such as during filleting and canning the fish for export and sale to consumer, according to an NGO report. Additionally, various NGO reports indicate that during the harvesting and processing stages, seafood caught with forced labor may be combined with legally caught seafood, making illegal shipments more difficult to identify. For example, companies may combine catches from several smaller boats onto a bigger vessel before transporting it to shore for processing. Moreover, some seafood supply chains have an additional layer of complexity because low-value fish may not be directly exported but, rather, used as feed for farm-raised seafood that could eventually be imported into the United States. Forced labor related to this type of situation can be difficult to detect because the source of feed for farm- raised fish is an early step in a supply chain that occurs well before the seafood is imported into the United States, according to CBP officials. Federal law prohibits the import of goods made with forced labor. In particular, section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 prohibits the importation of goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured, wholly or in part, in any foreign country by convict labor, forced labor, or indentured labor under penal sanctions. TFTEA, enacted in February 2016, among other things, amended section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 by repealing an exception referred to as the consumptive demand clause. The consumptive demand clause permitted the importation of certain forced labor-produced goods if they were not produced “in such quantities in the United States as to meet the consumptive demands of the United States.” determination that merchandise was produced with forced labor in violation of section 307, the Commissioner will publish a formal finding. Various other laws and regulations are also relevant to IUU fishing and the importation of illegally harvested seafood into the United States. For example, under the High Seas Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Act, among other things, the Secretary of Commerce is charged with identifying and certifying countries that have fishing vessels engaged in IUU. According to NOAA officials, a negative certification may result in restrictions on the importation of some fish and fish products at a port of entry. NOAA also administers and enforces a number of statutes that include prohibitions on the importation of illegally harvested seafood, most notably the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act and the Lacey Act. Under these authorities and others, NOAA enforces a number of trade monitoring programs. For example, NOAA administers the Seafood Import Monitoring Program (SIMP), which establishes permitting, data reporting, and recordkeeping procedures for the importation of 13 species of fish and fish products identified as being at particular risk of IUU fishing or seafood fraud. NOAA also implements the Tuna Tracking and Verification Program, which monitors domestic cannery production and importation of all frozen and processed tuna products to ensure compliance with federal requirements regarding dolphin-safe certification. A number of federal agencies and stakeholders are involved in or have an interest in forced labor and seafood-related efforts. In particular, CBP is responsible for enforcing violations of section 307 as part of its overall efforts to deter and detect violations of U.S. customs and trade laws at the more than 300 ports of entry into the United States. CBP’s enforcement efforts include, but are not limited to, actions to identify, detain, seize or exclude illegitimate imports, including imports produced by forced labor, counterfeits, and goods evading customs duties. After passage of TFTEA in 2016, CBP initiated new efforts to emphasize and focus on enforcement of section 307. Specifically, CBP formally established its Forced Labor Division in March 2018, within its Office of Trade. Since its inception, the Forced Labor Division has grown in size, according to CBP officials, with about 12 staff onboard as of the end of 2019, mainly comprised of analysts and international trade specialists. The Forced Labor Division does not have staff in other countries, but CBP can leverage foreign attachés from other CBP offices, to the extent they are available, to assist with enforcement of section 307, according to CBP officials. Staff in the Forced Labor Division also collaborate with others throughout CBP, including the Office of Field Operations, which, among other things, oversees operations at U.S. ports. Other federal agencies, such as the Department of State and the Department of Labor, conduct activities and collect information related to forced labor. According to CBP officials, CBP may use information from these federal agencies to help support its enforcement of section 307 for particular cases, including those involving seafood. Also, since the enactment of TFTEA in 2016, a number of working groups or task forces have been established, primarily involving U.S. federal agencies, to share information collected related to forced labor and imports, in general, as well as illegal activities involving fishing more specifically, in some cases (see app. II). In addition, numerous stakeholders, such as NGOs, also have an interest in combating forced labor, including forced labor related to the seafood industry. Often stakeholders’ interests in forced labor include other human rights issues or are broader than specific commodities such as seafood. Stakeholders may provide a variety of services to advocate for workers and identify potential forced labor. For example, some NGOs investigate potential human rights abuses of workers in the seafood industry while others focus on collecting data to help other interested stakeholders identify cases of forced labor. Other NGOs may work with importers who have interests in corporate social responsibility by helping them identify potential issues in their supply chain and comply with U.S. laws, including section 307. CBP enforces section 307 involving seafood imports generally following the same process it uses for any other goods suspected of being produced with forced labor imported into the United States, such as apparel, electronics, or consumer products. CBP carries out its process through its Forced Labor Division, in collaboration with other offices across CBP. According to CBP documents and officials, the process CBP uses to enforce section 307 generally includes four phases: (1) assessing leads to determine whether to initiate a case; (2) investigating cases; (3) reviewing information for legal sufficiency to propose a WRO; and (4) implementing the WRO and detaining shipments (see fig. 3). An importer has several options if CBP detains its shipment, including contesting the WRO or deciding not to enter the good into U.S. commerce. Phase 1: Initiation. CBP analysts within the Forced Labor Division assess leads for credibility when deciding whether to initiate cases involving potential forced labor at any point in the supply chain for a particular good. According to CBP officials, an analyst would examine, for example, whether an allegation made by an external party is credible, the goods in question are being imported into the United States, and sufficient information is available on potential forced labor to initiate and build a case. CBP officials told us that they do not have the resources to gather firsthand information on labor practices such as on fishing vessels or processing operations overseas, but that they can initiate cases based on information obtained from external sources. For example, CBP may receive information through its e- allegations system, which is CBP’s online mechanism for the public to report any suspected violations of trade laws or regulations related to the importation of goods into the United States. In addition, CBP may receive an allegation directly from external entities, such as NGOs; letters from industry or other concerned parties; and information from other U.S. government agencies. Publicly available information, such as media reports or NGO publications, can also serve as leads for CBP to self-initiate a case. If CBP’s initial evaluation shows further evaluation is warranted, CBP initiates a case and moves to the next phase. Phase 2: Investigation. CBP analysts investigate cases by collecting information from various sources to help determine whether the evidence “reasonably but not conclusively” indicates that goods being imported into the United States were produced with forced labor, according to CBP officials. For example, analysts may ask other federal agencies for information, such as import data, or speak with NGOs that may have information about a particular good or supply chain overseas. CBP officials also said they may investigate the strength of the information collected as part of their case development. In doing so, they said the Forced Labor Division uses the International Labor Organization’s forced labor indicators, among other standards, to help evaluate the sufficiency of evidence for forced labor conditions. If there is insufficient evidence to continue investigating a case, the Forced Labor Division may either close or suspend it pending further information, according to CBP officials. If there is sufficient evidence to propose a WRO, the case moves to the next phase. Phase 3: Legal review. CBP’s Forced Labor Division prepares a package, which includes an assessment of evidence and a justification for a proposed WRO for the goods suspected to be produced with forced labor, and submits it to CBP’s Office of Chief Counsel for legal review. To propose a WRO, CBP officials said that the package must provide sufficient evidence to reasonably but not conclusively indicate a violation of section 307. This entails having sufficient supply chain information showing importation of a good harvested, produced, or otherwise manufactured with forced labor, according to CBP officials. During its legal review, the Office of Chief Counsel may request additional information or have discussions with the Forced Labor Division. If the Office of Chief Counsel determines there is insufficient evidence to proceed with a WRO, then the Forced Labor Division may choose to close the case or suspend it and consider whether to seek additional information for the case. If the Office of Chief Counsel determines there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a WRO, then the Forced Labor Division prepares a WRO package to be presented to the CBP Commissioner for review and approval. Phase 4: Implementation. Once the CBP Commissioner issues a WRO, CBP is responsible for implementing the parameters of the WRO. According to CBP officials, numerous officials within CBP, including those at U.S. ports and the Centers of Excellence and Expertise, are responsible for implementation. CBP officials located at U.S. ports screen import data to identify, hold, and detain shipments associated with a WRO. When CBP detains a shipment subject to a WRO at a port of entry, the importer has the option to reexport the shipment to a different country. Alternatively, officials said the importer can contest the detention and provide additional information to show that the shipment did not contain forced labor elements. If CBP determines the importer has provided sufficient evidence, it allows the shipment to enter into U.S. commerce. Should the importer not provide additional information, the shipment can be excluded (not admitted into U.S. commerce) and/or seized and destroyed in certain circumstances, according to CBP officials. A WRO remains in place until the circumstances surrounding the original WRO change to indicate that forced labor is no longer part of the production or manufacturing process, and the CBP Commissioner revokes the order, according to CBP documents. CBP officials said the agency can also issue civil penalties to importers for forced labor violations for importing goods in violation of section 307, where appropriate. CBP’s Forced Labor Division tracks its cases of suspected forced labor violations, including seafood cases, in a case-tracking spreadsheet throughout the various phases of the enforcement process. The spreadsheet notes the status of each case as (1) open and active, (2) suspended, or (3) closed/inactive. At any given time, the Forced Labor Division may be working on a number of seafood cases that are in various phases of the enforcement process, according to CBP officials. Further, officials said the status of these cases changes as new information becomes available. Data CBP provided to us showed a small number of open and active cases as well as suspended cases that were related to seafood. CBP officials stated that they suspended these seafood cases partly because they lacked personnel to obtain additional information to further investigate the cases. In other instances, they said they may suspend cases while waiting for additional information, which may take significant time to obtain. From February 2016—when TFTEA was enacted—through March 2020, CBP issued 13 WROs for goods suspected of violating section 307, of which one involved seafood, according to CBP data (see table 1). The seafood-related WRO was for all seafood imports caught by the fishing vessel Tunago No. 61, registered in Vanuatu, an island nation in Oceania. After issuing the WRO in February 2019, CBP detained multiple shipments of seafood, according to CBP data, but revoked the order at the end of March 2020. CBP’s other WROs cover a variety of goods such as cotton, toys, food, and agricultural products. Six of the 13 WROs included imports from China, while several WROs included goods from African countries. As of March 2020, CBP officials said they had not issued any civil penalties for forced labor violations involving seafood imports. CBP officials told us they obtain and use information from a variety of external sources, including media reports, other federal agencies, and stakeholders, that can help them initiate new forced labor-related cases or advance existing ones. CBP officials said that media reports can be a catalyst for its Forced Labor Division to initiate or investigate a case. For example, CBP officials noted that forced labor in Thailand’s shrimp industry had been in the news since 2015, and in response, CBP collected additional information from companies importing shrimp from Thailand. Additionally, the Forced Labor Division initiated the case that resulted in the seafood-related WRO based partially on news reporting, according to CBP officials. CBP officials also told us that they have formed working relationships with journalists that can be helpful in obtaining information to initiate or investigate cases. CBP also uses information on an as-needed basis from a variety of federal agencies to initiate and investigate cases, according to CBP officials. NOAA. CBP can use certain data collected through NOAA’s trade monitoring programs to help the agency support specific forced labor cases for seafood, according to CBP officials. For example, in the case of the seafood-related WRO, CBP officials told us they used vessel names collected through NOAA’s Tuna Tracking and Verification Program to link specific shipments of tuna to the vessel in question, which CBP officials said was essential information to confirm imports were being made to the United States. This information was available because the seafood in question was one of the species of fish subject to NOAA trade monitoring programs that generate data CBP can access; however, not all species of fish are included in these programs. Through its trade monitoring programs, NOAA collects harvest-related data, such as the name of the fishing vessel and the species of fish caught, but NOAA officials told us the agency does not collect data specific to labor conditions. NOAA officials and other stakeholders said that there have been discussions regarding potentially expanding the scope of data collected through NOAA’s trade-monitoring programs, such as SIMP, to collect labor-related data. However, the officials noted some potential difficulties in doing so. For example, NOAA officials said that they would need to determine what specific information would be feasible to collect from importers and how it would collect, review, and validate such information. Some NOAA officials raised concern that collecting data on labor conditions may be outside NOAA’s mission; as such, the agency may not have a clear use for the data once collected. The Department of Labor. CBP officials told us they may use reports published by the Department of Labor for context to inform section 307 investigations, including those involving seafood. CBP officials also said they may reach out to the department on an as-needed basis to seek additional information. According to Department of Labor officials, the department also contacts other U.S. government agencies, including CBP, on an ad-hoc basis to share information. The Department of State. CBP officials said they may use reports published by the Department of State for contextual information in their enforcement of section 307, including investigation of cases involving seafood. CBP officials also said that the Department of State may include CBP in official communications from embassies discussing potential instances of forced labor. Department of State officials also said that they may reach out to CBP on a case-by-case basis regarding issues of potential forced labor detected in the course of their work overseas. CBP officials said they may use information from stakeholders to initiate or investigate cases. For example, CBP officials stated that they have reached out to NGOs to obtain clarification on sources used in NGOs’ reports for specific cases. Stakeholders can also submit information or allegations proactively to the agency. CBP officials said that firsthand information collected in-country, including victim accounts, can be beneficial for initiating or investigating forced labor cases. We found many stakeholders collect such information. For example, a representative from one NGO told us that its organization conducts interviews with laborers from fishing vessels once the vessels dock to gather information on labor payment practices, which can serve as an indicator of potential forced labor. However, CBP officials said they also face challenges using information provided by stakeholders because information is often insufficient to initiate or investigate a forced labor case. For example, CBP officials said that information they receive from NGOs might not provide sufficient detail on the supply chain that includes the alleged forced labor, including the manufacturer or vessel committing forced labor, or the connection to a U.S. importer. Additionally, these officials told us that information from stakeholders may conflate poor working conditions with forced labor. Firsthand Account of Abuse and Potential Forced Labor Involving Workers on Fishing Vessels In its 2019 Seabound report, Greenpeace included testimonials of migrant fishers that detailed abuse and violent conditions on fishing vessels: “I witnessed horrible torture. We were working even on midnights. When the Fishing Master was angry, he hit my friend’s head near his left ear. After that he was forced to continue working until the work was finished and only then was he allowed to rest. In the morning when we woke up for breakfast, we found him dead in his room. The Captain wrapped up my dead friend’s body with a blanket and then stored him in the freezer.” According to stakeholders we interviewed and our review of information on CBP’s website, CBP has not clearly communicated its information needs externally. Representatives from 14 of the 18 NGOs we interviewed indicated that they had some uncertainty about the types and level of information CBP needs to investigate forced labor cases in the seafood industry. For example, representatives from one NGO said it was not clear what constituted a credible allegation for CBP, or what information CBP needs to make a section 307 determination. Additionally, representatives from two NGOs managing a grant program designed to support nonprofit organizations collecting firsthand evidence of forced labor said that they were unable to obtain specific guidance from CBP on the types of information the agency needs. As a result, these representatives said they could not communicate to potential grantees the specific kinds of information that would be most useful to submit to CBP. In asking CBP officials about this, CBP confirmed that the NGOs had reached out but they misunderstood the goals of the grant program at the time. CBP could improve the quality of information it receives from stakeholders, including NGOs, by better communicating what information is most useful to initiate and investigate forced labor cases, including those involving seafood, according to stakeholders. Of the 14 stakeholders that told us there was uncertainty, 11 indicated that additional or clearer information about the agency’s information needs could result in more reporting of information to CBP. For example, representatives from one NGO said there was reluctance among stakeholders that may have limited resources to develop an allegation without knowing whether it is helpful, and that they would be more likely to do so with a better understanding of CBP’s needs. Similarly, representatives from another NGO said it is not worth dedicating the time and resources to develop an allegation without a clear sense of the types of information CBP is looking for to investigate its forced labor cases. Many of these stakeholders indicated that they are collecting firsthand information about potential forced labor in seafood supply chains in countries where labor violations are prevalent, which is information CBP officials told us could benefit forced labor investigations. CBP officials said they have communicated in general about their information needs for forced labor cases, and that requisite information varies by case, including for seafood cases. The agency’s website contains some information, including a reference to a regulation identifying information individuals are to submit to CBP when making a forced labor allegation. However, CBP does not indicate what specific information to submit such as the timing or location of alleged forced labor activities. Similarly, CBP does not provide examples of the type of information—such as photos or testimonials from victims—that could be useful information for initiating or investigating cases. In addition, CBP officials said that their e-allegations system provides a means for stakeholders to submit allegations of potential forced labor, among other things, to the agency. However, as of April 2020, the instructions for submitting an allegation do not include specifics on the types of information CBP needs to initiate or investigate cases, such as whether photographs or firsthand accounts of forced labor could be helpful. CBP officials agreed with the need to better communicate to stakeholders the types of information that are helpful for initiating or investigating forced labor cases. They said that the Forced Labor Division had begun considering how it might do so but, to date, had yet to identify further details such as the approach it might take. Federal standards for internal control establish that management should externally communicate the necessary quality information to achieve an agency’s objectives. For example, an agency should use appropriate methods to communicate quality information so that external parties can help the agency achieve its objectives. With better communication to stakeholders about the types of information it needs to initiate and investigate forced labor cases, CBP may be able to improve its enforcement efforts through enhanced information from stakeholders. The exploitation of labor in the seafood supply chain is a global issue that, according to a recent United Nations report, affects millions of people working in the fishing sector. With the United States importing billions of dollars’ worth of seafood in 2018 and reliant on those imports for much of the seafood it consumes, it is important that CBP take action to detect and prevent imports produced with forced labor from entering the country. Following the enactment of TFTEA in February 2016, CBP created the Forced Labor Division and placed an increased emphasis on detecting forced labor in imports, including seafood. CBP officials told us they do not have the resources to gather firsthand information on labor practices. To this end, CBP uses information from a variety of sources, including external stakeholders such as NGOs, to initiate and investigate cases. However, stakeholders are unclear about the types of information CBP needs to initiate and investigate cases because CBP has not clearly communicated this information. As a result, CBP may be missing opportunities to obtain key information that stakeholders collect specific to forced labor in the seafood industry—information that could enhance CBP’s enforcement efforts. The Acting Commissioner of CBP should better communicate to stakeholders the types of information stakeholders could collect and submit to CBP to help the agency initiate and investigate forced labor cases related to seafood and, as appropriate, other goods. (Recommendation 1) We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, Justice, Labor, State, and the U.S. Agency for International Development for review and comment. We received written comments from the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which are reproduced in appendixes III and IV, respectively. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with our recommendation and noted that CBP is committed to continued collaboration and communication with stakeholders about the types of information needed to develop forced labor cases and improve enforcement efforts of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. CBP described the actions it plans to take to address the recommendation, including steps to improve collaboration and information sharing during meetings with working groups. In addition, the Departments of Commerce, Homeland Security, Justice, Labor, and State provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees; the Secretaries of Commerce, Homeland Security, Justice, Labor, and State; and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact Anne-Marie Fennell at (202) 512-3841 or fennella@gao.gov or Kimberly Gianopoulos at (202) 512-8612 or gianopoulosk@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. The objectives of this report are to examine (1) the process U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses to enforce section 307 for seafood imports and the results of its civil enforcement actions and (2) the external sources of information CBP uses to help carry out enforcement of section 307 specific to seafood imports and stakeholder perspectives on CBP’s communication of information needs. To examine the process the Department of Homeland Security’s CBP uses to enforce section 307 for seafood imports, we reviewed laws, regulations, and CBP documents and data pertaining to section 307 enforcement. These laws included section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA). We interviewed CBP officials from the Office of Trade and Office of Field Operations, in both Washington, D.C., and the field, who are involved in forced labor detection and enforcement about the steps in CBP’s process to enforce section 307. In addition, we interviewed officials from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to learn about their involvement in addressing section 307. We examined CBP’s efforts to enforce section 307 since TFTEA was enacted, in February 2016, through March 2020, the most currently available information at the time of our review. We examined CBP’s enforcement of section 307 but did not include other forced labor laws in the scope of our review. To describe the results of CBP’s civil enforcement actions, we looked at enforcement actions CBP took from February 2016—when TFTEA was enacted—through March 2020. We reviewed CBP’s list of civil enforcement actions pertaining to all commodities it published on its website. In addition, we collected and analyzed information specific to seafood from a spreadsheet that CBP uses to track cases, which contains information on all of its active, suspended, and inactive forced labor investigations pertaining to section 307. CBP provided us with updated versions of this case-tracking spreadsheet in July 2019, November 2019, and March 2020. To assess the reliability of the data, we interviewed CBP officials about the accuracy and completeness of the data and discussed each seafood case to understand the data represented in the various fields, such as how the seafood case originated and what the outcome of the case was. We also discussed in detail the information that led to the one seafood withhold release order (WRO) CBP issued in February 2019. Based on our interviews with CBP officials, we determined that the seafood case data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of describing CBP’s enforcement actions. To describe the external sources of information CBP uses to help carry out enforcement of section 307 for seafood, we conducted interviews with CBP officials, including officials in the Office of Trade, which includes the Forced Labor Division, and the Office of Field Operations, to learn about the types of information they gather from external sources and how they might use that information. In addition, we interviewed various other federal agencies and stakeholders that collect information that could be relevant to CBP’s enforcement of section 307. We identified these agencies by interviewing CBP officials about the external sources of information they use to help enforce section 307 cases. Federal agencies. We interviewed the following agencies: Department of Commerce’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Justice, Department of Labor, Department of State, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Agency for International Development. We also interviewed officials from NOAA about the Seafood Import Monitoring Program and other trade-related programs that collect data aimed at preventing illegal, unreported, and unregulated seafood from entering the United States. In addition, we reviewed documents provided by NOAA that focused on trade programs that CBP could use as a source of information to help carry out enforcement of section 307. We interviewed officials from the Departments of State and Labor about each agency’s reports on human trafficking and forced labor and obtained copies of and reviewed their reports. Stakeholders. We interviewed current and former representatives from 18 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that have interests in forced labor in the seafood industry. Our original scope included 19 NGOs, but we eliminated one NGO from our scope since an official from this organization told us its responses would not vary from those we received from a larger parent NGO, and officials we interviewed did not have separate viewpoints on the extent to which they understood CBP’s information needs. We identified NGOs using internet searches for groups focused on seafood and forced labor and the recommendations of officials from federal agencies and NGOs we interviewed. We also selected NGOs that represented a variety of goals and missions, including those focused on helping U.S. importers remain compliant with section 307 and those focused on assistance to survivors of forced labor overseas. We asked representatives from each NGO a standard set of questions that addressed, among other things, information they may share with CBP. Statements these stakeholders made are not generalizable to all stakeholders but provide perspectives on information for enforcing section 307. To describe stakeholder perspectives on CBP’s communication of information needs, we interviewed stakeholders about their perspectives of CBP’s information needs. Specifically, we asked about the extent to which they understood CBP’s information needs for enforcement of section 307, the extent to which they have shared information with CBP about potential forced labor they have identified, and factors that may affect their sharing information with CBP. In some cases, NGO representatives we interviewed told us their organizations were unable to share information with CBP because of external factors, such as nondisclosure agreements or differing information collection objectives, but they noted that CBP actions could affect the likelihood of other stakeholders sharing information. Statements these stakeholders made are not generalizable to all stakeholders but provide perspectives on information sources. We also interviewed CBP officials about the extent to which information stakeholders provided was sufficient to use in initiating and investigating section 307 cases. To evaluate CBP’s communication of its information needs to initiate or investigate forced labor cases as part of its section 307 enforcement process, we interviewed CBP officials about how the agency communicates its information needs to initiate or investigate forced labor cases as part of its section 307 enforcement process. We also reviewed CBP documents and the agency’s website to identify what information CBP provided to the public about its information needs. We compared the agency’s existing communication efforts to federal standards for internal control, as appropriate. We assessed the agency’s procedures to determine whether CBP communicated information to external parties through appropriate methods. We also assessed the quality of available information to ensure it was appropriate, current, complete, and accessible, among other things. We conducted this performance audit from February 2019 to June 2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Since the enactment of the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA), a number of working groups or task forces have been established, primarily involving U.S. federal agencies, to focus on forced labor and imports in general as well as combating illegal activities in the seafood supply chain more specifically in some cases. Interagency Working Group on Forced Labor. The Department of Homeland Security established this working group in 2017. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials, the group’s purpose is information sharing and collaboration on forced labor topics with interagency partners, which include officials from the Departments of Labor, State, and Justice and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), among other federal agencies. CBP officials stated that the group generally meets monthly. Task Force on Human Trafficking in Fishing in International Waters. In 2017, the Senate Appropriations Committee directed the Department of Justice to lead a multi-agency task force to examine the issue of human trafficking in seafood supply chains and report to Congress on the status of such issues, along with any related funding, policy recommendations, and legal decisions. Department of Justice officials said they launched the task force in October 2018, and it includes officials from NOAA; the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, State, Labor, and Treasury; and the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Department of Justice officials said they drafted a report that identified relevant legal and jurisdictional issues, with recommendations to help further efforts to limit human trafficking in fishing in international waters. As of March 2020, the draft was undergoing interagency review and no publication date had been specified, according to the officials. Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee Forced Labor Working Group. The Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee is a longstanding public-private partnership between the federal government and the private sector. It advises the Department of Homeland Security on matters involving commercial operations, including significant changes that are proposed to CBP regulations, policies, or practices. After the enactment of TFTEA, a working group within the committee’s Intelligent Enforcement Subcommittee—the Forced Labor Working Group—began discussing a variety of issues related to the implementation of section 307, according to CBP officials. The officials said that in 2017 the Forced Labor Working Group sought information from several nongovernmental organizations knowledgeable about labor and human rights in sectors involving seafood and other goods to obtain their insights that could then be shared with CBP. In addition to the contacts named above, Alyssa M. Hundrup (Assistant Director), Christine Broderick (Assistant Director), Christina Werth (Assistant Director), Andrea Riba Miller (Analyst in Charge), and Emily Norman made key contributions to this report. Martin De Alteriis, Patricia Moye, Sheryl Stein, Sara Sullivan, and Nicole Willems also contributed to the report.\n","  15  SOCOM has a unique structure and responsibilities in that it has both combatant command responsibilities and military service-like functions for organizing, training, and equipping SOF. Under sections 164 and 167 of Title 10, United States Code, the SOCOM commander is responsible for training and ensuring the combat readiness of assigned forces and monitoring the preparedness to carry out assigned missions of SOF assigned to unified combatant commands. In addition, SOCOM is responsible for developing special operations strategy, doctrine, and tactics; the employment of forces of the command to carry out assigned missions; requirements validation; acquisition of special operations- peculiar equipment; and formulating and submitting requirements for intelligence support, among other things. In its combatant command function, the commander of SOCOM is responsible for and has the authority to conduct the following special operations activities: (1) direct action, (2) strategic reconnaissance, (3) unconventional warfare, (4) foreign internal defense, (5) civil affairs, (6) military information support operations, (7) counterterrorism, (8) humanitarian assistance, (9) theater search and rescue, and (10) other activities such as may be specified by the President or the Secretary of Defense. Congress initially established the position of the ASD-SO/LIC in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 1987. As previously discussed, in 2016 Congress enhanced the role of the ASD-SO/LIC in section 922, which is codified in section 138(b) of Title 10, United States Code. The ASD-SO/LIC’s current statutory responsibilities include overall supervision, including policy and resources, of special operations activities listed above; exercising authority, direction, and control of all special operations-peculiar administrative matters relating to the organization, training, and equipping of SOF; and assisting the Secretary of Defense and USD (P) in the development and supervision of policy, program planning and execution, and allocation and use of resources for irregular warfare, combating terrorism, and special operations activities. DOD Directive 5111.10, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (SO/LIC), first issued in 1995 and most recently updated in 2011, also prescribes the roles and responsibilities for the ASD-SO/LIC. Among other things, the ASD- SO/LIC serves as the principal staff assistant to the USD (P) and the Secretary of Defense on special operations and low-intensity conflict matters and counterdrug policy, among others. DOD Directive 5111.10 also establishes responsibilities, functions, relationships, and authorities for the ASD-SO/LIC on issues such as the coordination and oversight of policy for humanitarian assistance, refugee affairs, and foreign disaster relief activities (e.g., emergency relief for Ebola). Prior to the enactment of section 922, OASD-SO/LIC coordinated regularly with SOCOM on administrative matters, such as reviewing SOCOM’s budget materials. Specifically, the administrative chain of command for SOF-related matters was formally changed by section 922 to give the ASD-SO/LIC more oversight over SOCOM through direct interaction with the Secretary of Defense. Section 922 provided the ASD-SO/LIC with the statutory authority to exercise authority, direction, and control of all special operations-peculiar administrative matters relating to organizing, training, and equipping SOF. Section 922 did not alter SOCOM’s operational chain of command as a combatant command. Section 1074 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2018 directed DOD to submit a report on the progress the department had made in implementing the requirements identified in section 922. Section 1074 specified seven reporting elements, such as the accounting of personnel currently assigned, that DOD’s report should address. DOD submitted its report on March 12, 2018, wherein it identified a high-level summary of actions taken, as shown in table 1 below. In 2018, DOD identified 166 recommendations to address the reforms required by section 922 that are aimed at increasing the ASD-SO/LIC’s role in the management of SOF and special operations. To identify these recommendations and support the implementation of service secretary- like responsibilities under section 922, OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM created a “tiger team” to review broad functional areas typically performed by the military service secretariats and determine the need for potential changes to the roles and responsibilities of OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM related to addressing requirements in section 922. The tiger team included five working groups to review potential roles and responsibilities for budget, special access programs, personnel and readiness, program and requirements, and acquisition functions. Two officials, respectively representing OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM, co-led each of these working groups. OASD-SO/LIC established design principles to help the working groups identify new roles and responsibilities for OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM under section 922. These principles included the following three broad categories of authorities that OASD-SO/LIC could be expected to take on: Monitor: This role requires that OASD-SO/LIC be informed, observe, and check the progress or quality of an activity throughout the lifetime of the activity. This includes, for example, monitoring SOCOM’s submission of its presidential budget justification material to Congress. Review and coordinate: This role requires that OASD-SO/LIC review, analyze, and coordinate throughout the lifetime of an activity to ensure compliance with authoritative policy and with statutory and other regulatory issuances, and to ensure achievement of broad program goals. Coordination does not imply authority to compel agreement, however. An example of the review and coordinate role is that OASD-SO/LIC liaises with the military departments on military personnel issues. Approve: This role requires OASD-SO/LIC’s concurrence to give explicit or official sanction, permission, or ratification of an activity. An example of approval authority is that ASD-SO/LIC approves SOCOM’s Program Objective Memorandum (POM). We found the largest share of the 166 recommendations made by the working groups strengthened OASD-SO/LIC’s roles related to monitor and to review and coordinate, as shown in figure 1. Specifically, 80 out of 166 recommendations (48 percent) would strengthen OASD-SO/LIC’s role regarding monitor or review and coordinate. Twenty-two out of 166 recommendations (13 percent) would give OASD-SO/LIC approval authority—requiring OASD-SO/LIC’s concurrence to give explicit or official sanction, permission, or ratification of an activity. Of these 22 recommendations, 16 involved either joint approval—requiring both OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM to jointly approve the action—or partial approval—that is, OASD-SO/LIC would have approval authority on certain aspects of an action item. Sixty-four out of 166 recommendations (39 percent) did not recommend any change to OASD-SO/LIC’s role. In addition, the majority of the recommendations, about 156 out of 166 (about 94 percent) would not change SOCOM’s roles. OASD-SO/LIC used the 166 recommendations to inform the development of 87 actions in OASD-SO/LIC’s monthly reports to Congress. We found that with regard to the 87 actions identified in OASD-SO/LIC’s February 2019 monthly report, 49 percent of the action items (43 out of 87) focused on OASD-SO/LIC’s participation in meetings. For example, prior to the implementation of section 922, OASD-SO/LIC attended Joint Resources Management Board meetings. After implementing section 922, OASD- SO/LIC exercised its review and coordinate responsibility by attending Joint Resources Management Board meetings, thereby formalizing OASD-SO/LIC’s prior role. According to DOD officials, there is a value in adding OASD-SO/LIC as a participant in key meetings and formalizing OASD-SO/LIC’s review and coordinate role. For example, officials explained that, by participating in meetings, OASD-SO/LIC can have more situational awareness about key topics and can better advocate for the SOF enterprise. DOD, through OASD-SO/LIC, has taken various actions, including changes in roles and responsibilities, related to addressing requirements in section 922. According to OASD-SO/LIC officials, its actions reflect an incremental approach to strengthening OASD-SO/LIC’s roles and responsibilities. In February 2019 OASD-SO/LIC reported to Congress that it had completed 56 of its 87 actions. For example, one of the actions identified in the February 2019 monthly report was the need to enhance OASD-SO/LIC’s role in the development and approval of SOF-related program and budget matters. The report further identified a number of actions, including having OASD-SO/LIC approve SOCOM’s POM. According to the report, OASD-SO/LIC was briefed on and approved SOCOM’s POM for fiscal years 2020-2024. As another example, the report identified the need to enhance OASD-SO/LIC’s oversight of SOF- related military construction activities and contingency basing. This included a requirement that OASD-SO/LIC co-chair SOCOM’s Military Construction Summit, which according to officials deals with acquisition- related issues regarding military construction and is used to inform the POM. According to the February 2019 report, OASD-SO/LIC co-chaired the summit for fiscal year 2019, and its formal role as co-chair will be reflected in future updates to SOCOM guidance. The February report also explained that the Deputy Secretary of Defense approved a new Special Operations Policy and Oversight Council directive that identified the ASD- SO/LIC as the lead for that council. The Deputy Secretary of Defense also delegated the ASD-SO/LIC with authority to approve waivers to hire civilian personnel during a civilian hiring freeze. Many of the actions taken thus far formalize pre-existing, informal relationships between OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM. According to OASD- SO/LIC officials, a formalization of a pre-existing role occurs when OASD- SO/LIC identifies a role that OASD-SO/LIC performed informally before addressing requirements under section 922 and continues to maintain the role officially under its section 922 responsibilities. Based on the February 2019 report to Congress, we found that 26 out of 56 implemented action items (about 50 percent) formalize ongoing OASD- SO/LIC roles and responsibilities that were previously conducted informally. Officials stated that all of the actions relating to budget execution are formalizations of previously existing informal roles and responsibilities. For example, according to OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM officials, OASD-SO/LIC had an informal role in reviewing SOCOM’s POM prior to section 922, such as participating in the review of the POM without formal approval authority. According to DOD officials familiar with the POM process, giving OASD-SO/LIC approval authority for SOCOM’s POM essentially formalized what had been done in the past, while allowing OASD-SO/LIC to perform a more thorough review. Similarly, officials stated that OASD-SO/LIC had an informal role in developing SOCOM’s budget justification books prior to the passage of section 922. Another action identified in DOD’s February 2019 monthly report is OASD-SO/LIC’s role in budget submission. Officials explained that, in an effort to enhance OASD-SO/LIC’s role in budget submission, OASD- SO/LIC has formalized this role. According to the officials, the benefit of this formalization is that OASD-SO/LIC has greater access to the process of producing justification books. There have been similar examples of formalization of pre-existing roles in other areas as well. For example, prior to section 922, SOCOM’s public affairs requirements were coordinated with USD (P)’s public affairs office. Rather than duplicate SOCOM’s existing public affairs role with an additional public affairs office for the ASD-SO/LIC, OASD-SO/LIC coordinates with the USD (P)’s public affairs office. Most of the actions remaining to be implemented do not have clear time frames for implementation. Based on our analysis of the February 2019 monthly report, we found that 31 out of 87 identified actions remain unimplemented. Of these 31 actions, three have clear time frames for implementation. For example, one of the remaining actions involves enhancing the ASD-SO/LIC’s role in SOF military personnel-related issues. Among other things, this includes liaising with the military departments on relevant military personnel issues and coordinating on related policy issues. The February 2019 monthly report includes an action related to OASD-SO/LIC’s plans to coordinate a process to monitor promotions of SOF personnel and communicate issues with military departments. The report specifies that the ASD-SO/LIC expected to implement this process in 2019. As another example, documenting and funding for the Secretariat for Special Operations was expected to be resolved by the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. However, the remaining 28 actions do not have time frames for implementation. For example, some of the actions associated with implementing the ASD-SO/LIC’s key functions, such as acquisitions and legislative affairs, do not have clear time frames for implementation. Regarding acquisitions, OASD-SO/LIC is developing standard operating procedures, such as regular coordination and meetings, but it has not established time frames for the creation or implementation of these procedures. Similarly, OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM are prescribing roles with regard to legislative affairs pending further departmental guidance, but they have not established time frames within which these roles will be defined. DOD officials identified some reasons for not having identified time frames for the remaining actions. First, according to OASD-SO/LIC officials, their initial efforts were focused on identifying and prioritizing the list of actions needed to implement section 922, as reflected in the March 2018 report required by law. Since then, according to OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM officials, OASD-SO/LIC has taken an incremental approach to implementing these actions, addressing items on a case-by-case basis as they occur. For example, OASD-SO/LIC initially placed a higher priority on implementing its fiscal roles and responsibilities, partly because the POM cycle included deadlines associated with the President’s Budget for Fiscal Year 2020. Throughout the cycle, OASD-SO/LIC determined its specific role in each step of the POM process as the step arose. Second, OASD-SO/LIC officials stated that they had not established clear time frames linked to action items because the ASD-SO/LIC was new in that role and they were waiting for him to determine OASD-SO/LIC’s broader strategy and goals, which they could use to inform implementation time frames. However, we note that the ASD-SO/LIC has been in that position since December 2017, and OASD-SO/LIC has hired new personnel who could help develop and track time frames. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government emphasizes the need to establish time frames to implement actions effectively, and as we reported in June 2018, establishing time frames with key milestones and deliverables to track implementation progress are important for agency reform efforts. Failure to do so can have significant consequences. For example, by not establishing clear time frames for updating guidance that defines the ASD-SO/LIC’s acquisition roles, the ASD-SO/LIC is at risk for having unclear roles and responsibilities that may overlap between SOCOM and the Office of the Secretary of Defense on functions related to acquisitions. According SOCOM officials, having clearer time frames to update DOD guidance could enable OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM to operate more efficiently and effectively. Without establishing clear time frames for the implementation of key oversight functions and other actions, the ASD-SO/LIC may not be able to fully execute OASD- SO/LIC’s service secretary-like authority, and DOD decision-makers may not be well positioned to track progress and evaluate whether or how the ASD-SO/LIC’s completed and pending actions support the full implementation of section 922. While the ASD- SO/LIC’s responsibilities, functions, relationships, and authorities are established in DOD Directive 5111.10, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (ASD SO/LIC) (Mar. 22, 1995) (incorporating Change 2, Oct. 21, 2011), this directive is outdated and does not reflect the ASD- SO/LIC’s statutory roles under section 922 and codified at 10 U.S.C. § 138. For example, DOD Directive 5111.10 states that the ASD- SO/LIC shall serve under the authority, direction, and control of the USD (P). However, section 922 states that the ASD- SO/LIC’s exercise of authority of all special operations-peculiar administrative matters related to the organization, training, and equipping of SOF shall be subject to the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense. According to DOD officials, while there is other guidance that broadly lays out DOD roles and responsibilities, this guidance lacks details concerning operationalizing ASD- SO/LIC’s roles and responsibilities under the new administrative chain of command, creating potential confusion regarding the ASD- SO/LIC’s roles and responsibilities on some key SOF-related issues. For example: SOF personnel issues: SOF personnel activities include readiness reporting, training, education, warrior care, awards, decorations, and death notification. Support for SOF personnel issues is generally dispersed among different components, including the military services, SOCOM, the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD (P&R)), and OASD- SO/LIC. Although DOD Directive 5111.10 states that the ASD- SO/LIC “shall advise and coordinate with the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness on manpower” issues, it does not define whether manpower issues include SOF career management, such as special pay and promotion. According to DOD officials, DOD lacks overarching guidance that would clarify ASD-SO/LIC’s role on manpower issues. DOD Directive 5111.10 also does not provide specific information about the extent of the ASD- SO/LIC’s coordination role as it relates, for example, to issues such as career management, retirement, pay, or promotion with regard to USD (P&R) responsibilities on SOF personnel management. As a result, according to DOD officials, the lack of clear and updated guidance has caused some confusion among DOD components. According to OASD-SO/LIC officials, after section 922 was implemented, OASD- SO/LIC’s initial attempts to provide strategic outreach for SOF personnel faced some challenges because officials were not included in key personnel meetings. For example, OASD-SO/LIC officials told us they were not included in some meetings that discussed delegating civilian hiring waivers. By not participating in some key SOF personnel-related meetings, OASD-SO/LIC could have missed the opportunity to advocate for similar waiver authority. According to DOD officials, USD (P&R) officials did not fully understand the ASD- SO/LIC’s authorities under section 922 when OASD-SO/LIC officials attended some meetings. Despite this confusion, the ASD-SO/LIC has taken some steps to strengthen its role on SOF personnel issues. For example, according to DOD officials, during the federal government civilian employee hiring freeze, DOD delegated civilian employee hiring waivers to the secretaries of the military departments but did not include waivers for the ASD-SO/LIC or SOCOM. Without the waiver authority to re-instate SOF personnel, SOCOM would have to request a waiver separately through the military services. OASD-SO/LIC officials told us that by ensuring the ASD-SO/LIC was granted a similar waiver authority, OASD-SO/LIC officials streamlined the process and supported SOCOM’s efforts to hire additional SOF civilian personnel. However, the ASD-SO/LIC’s authority on SOF personnel matters remains unclear and SOF personnel issues are generally dispersed among the authorities of USD (P&R), military services, and SOCOM. Overall, it remains unclear what, if any, authorities the ASD-SO/LIC has with respect to leading and coordinating the department’s SOF personnel issues. Budgetary authority: SOF-related budgetary issues include the SOCOM special operations–specific–funding budget materials, the POM, acquisition, and congressional requests for information, among other things. DOD officials told us that before section 922 was enacted, the ASD-SO/LIC reviewed SOF-peculiar budget materials (generally linked to major force program funding) prior to submission of the POM, and the ASD-SO/LIC was notified of SOF-related congressional unfunded priority list submissions. The ASD-SO/LIC did not have principal staff assistant authority to approve the POM. DOD Directive 5111.10 states that the ASD-SO/LIC will provide overall supervision of the preparation and justification of the SOF budget and programs and will review the SOCOM POM. However, the DOD directive has not been updated to provide the ASD-SO/LIC with clear oversight and approval authority over special operations– specific funding, which traditionally has been controlled by SOCOM. DOD Directive 5111.10 also states that the ASD-SO/LIC will advise and coordinate with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology on acquisition priorities, but this does not provide the ASD-SO/LIC with oversight of the SOF acquisition process. In addition, DOD does not have any guidance that gives ASD-SO/LIC clear oversight roles regarding the SOF acquisition process. By comparison, SOCOM is responsible for the development and acquisition of special operations-peculiar equipment, materiel, supplies, and services in accordance with section 167(e) of Title 10, U.S. Code, and it executes funding in operation and maintenance, procurement, and military construction accounts, among other things. According to OASD-SO/LIC senior officials, the ASD-SO/LIC has some authority over special operations–specific funding through the POM process. According to OASD-SO/LIC officials, after implementing section 922, the ASD-SO/LIC established a new principal staff assistant authority to approve the POM in 2018. However, DOD officials familiar with SOF-related budgetary issues stated that it is unclear how much authority the ASD-SO/LIC has over funding issues to adjudicate potential disagreements between the services and SOCOM on either SOF-specific or common funding issues. Special Access Programs (SAP): SAPs are programs established for a specific class of classified information that impose safeguarding and access requirements that exceed those normally required for information at the same classification level. Given the sensitive nature of these programs, DOD has established different levels of authorities to create and manage SAPs. According to DOD Directive 5205.07, Special Access Program (SAP) Policy, the Deputy Secretary of Defense designates certain DOD component heads, or DOD agency heads—for example, the secretary of a military department or the Commander, SOCOM—as cognizant authorities to manage and execute their respective SAPs. While the ASD-SO/LIC has always played a role in SOF-related SAPs, DOD officials stated that the role is expected to evolve as part of the implementation of section 922. OASD-SO/LIC’s February 2019 monthly report includes several actions intended to enhance the ASD-SO/LIC’s role in the management of SAPs, and OASD-SO/LIC has already begun participating in various SAP-related conferences and meetings. However, according to DOD officials, the ASD-SO/LIC’s future role related to SAPs remains unclear in existing guidance. For example, DOD Directive 5111.10 states that the ASD-SO/LIC will provide oversight over all special operations and low-intensity conflict related sensitive SAPs. Although the ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM officials told us that they are currently further defining these roles, the DOD directive has not been updated to clarify whether the ASD-SO/LIC should be included in the SAP governance process, which includes designating the ASD-SO/LIC as a cognizant authority with service secretary-like SAP responsibilities. DOD officials expressed some concerns that until these matters are clarified in guidance, it will remain unclear whether the ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM should work together on SAP issues, and how their relationships with the various Under Secretaries of Defense with oversight authority will be managed. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should define objectives clearly and assign responsibility for key roles throughout the organization. Specifically, the standards call for management to define objectives in specific terms so that they are understood at all levels of the entity. This involves clearly defining what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, and time frames for its achievement. We have also previously reported that management practices key to program success include clearly identifying organizational roles and responsibilities and clarifying program objectives. OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM officials stated that updated guidance is needed to help clarify the ASD-SO/LIC’s roles and responsibilities under section 922. In December 2018 OASD-SO/LIC officials told us that they were starting to update guidance on the ASD- SO/LIC’s roles and responsibilities under section 922 in DOD directive 5111.10. However, OASD-SO/LIC officials did not provide details about the information that would be updated, and did not provide a copy of that draft guidance. In addition, OASD-SO/LIC officials did not have clear time frames regarding when the guidance will be updated. As DOD updates the ASD-SO/LIC’s roles and responsibilities either in DOD Directive 5111.10 or through new guidance, it has an opportunity to clarify changes in its relationship with DOD components involved in overseeing SOF administrative matters related to personnel, budgetary authority, and SAPs. The SOF enterprise is a complex system, and without clearly identified roles and responsibilities for a service secretary- like role for the ASD-SO/LIC, other DOD components—such as the military departments, USD (P), and USD (P&R) —may not know the extent of the ASD-SO/LIC’s and SOCOM’s authorities in key issues where they have vested interests. For example, it will remain unclear what authorities the ASD-SO/LIC has with regard to SOF-related administrative matters, and which entities will have visibility over any problems or resourcing decisions related to the SOF enterprise. By clarifying the ASD-SO/LIC’s roles and responsibilities with regard to its relationship with SOCOM and other DOD components, DOD can more effectively implement the intent of section 922. OASD-SO/LIC has taken steps to develop a hiring plan to identify personnel requirements and an approach to hiring additional personnel. DOD’s efforts began in 2017, when OASD-SO/LIC commissioned the Army Office of Manpower and Reserve Affairs to conduct a manpower study to provide an analysis of manpower requirements based on unconstrained resources that are necessary to satisfy the service secretary-like responsibilities under section 922. The Army’s manpower study was based on nine functions, including budget, acquisitions, and legislative activities. For each function, the study identified corresponding tasks and the average man hours, or time needed, to complete each task. The study, which was included in DOD’s March 2018 report to Congress, ultimately estimated that up to 64 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions might be needed to implement the ASD-SO/LIC’s section 922 responsibilities. According to OASD-SO/LIC officials, the study provided an initial framework for OASD-SO/LIC to determine its staffing needs, but the study was not comprehensive and OASD-SO/LIC’s hiring needs will likely continue to change in the future. Over the past 2 years, according to OASD-SO/LIC officials, OASD- SO/LIC has begun to hire personnel to fulfill various roles and responsibilities. Specifically, the number of FTEs hired to support OASD- SO/LIC’s implementation of section 922 increased from 14 in March 2018 to 24 as of December 2018. In addition, section 361 of the John S. McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 gave the ASD-SO/LIC additional flexibility to hire staff in fiscal year 2019. For example, section 361 directed that not less than $4 million in fiscal year 2019 shall be used to fund additional civilian personnel to help implement section 922. Section 361 also provided the OASD-SO/LIC an exemption from the statutory civilian personnel limitation in the Office of the Secretary of Defense imposed by 10 U.S.C. § 143. Figure 2 shows OASD-SO/LIC’s hiring actions to date, along with key events related to the implementation of section 922. In December 2018 OASD-SO/LIC officials completed a basic hiring plan to guide future personnel growth as OASD-SO/LIC continues to implement actions related to section 922. The plan—documented in a 10 slide presentation—includes OASD-SO/LIC’s short-term hiring goals through the start of fiscal year 2020, a hiring approach involving a mix of permanent and temporary staff, and the identification of targeted skillsets for personnel hired. For example, the plan includes targets related to achieving key skills, such as force planning and shaping the President’s Budget for Fiscal Year 2021. The plan also calls for OASD-SO/LIC to grow from 27 current FTEs to a total of 55 FTEs in fiscal year 2020. While OASD-SO/LIC’s current hiring plan represents a first step toward developing a broad overview of its hiring goals and some key hiring considerations, it does not fully incorporate some leading practices for strategic workforce-planning. As we have previously reported, strategic workforce planning addresses two critical needs: (1) aligning an organization’s human capital program with its current and emerging mission and programmatic goals; and (2) developing long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining staff to achieve programmatic goals. While agencies’ approaches to workforce planning will vary, we have previously identified several key principles that strategic workforce planning should address, irrespective of the context in which the planning is done. GAO’s prior work on workforce planning identified the following five key principles: involve top management, employees, and other stakeholders in developing the strategic workforce plan; determine the critical skills and competencies needed to achieve long-term goals; develop strategies that are tailored to address critical competency gaps; build the capacity needed to address requirements important to supporting workforce strategies; and monitor and evaluate the agency’s progress toward its human capital goals. However, we found that as of December 2018, the OASD-SO/LIC’s hiring plan had not fully incorporated several of these key strategic workforce-planning principles, as described below: The hiring plan was not fully aligned with long-term goals. A key principle in strategic workforce planning is strategic alignment, which occurs when an agency’s human capital program is linked with its mission and goals. However, we found that OASD-SO/LIC has not clearly linked its hiring plan with its overall mission and goals. For example, the hiring plan mentions short-term goals, such as analyzing the budget for fiscal year 2021 and long-term goals, such as strategic assessment and aligning the organization with National Defense Strategy requirements. However, the plan does not define strategic assessment, and it lacks detail about how newly hired personnel in fiscal year 2019 will help OASD-SO/LIC meet long-term goals related to strategic assessment. For example, OASD-SO/LIC recently hired seven personnel, but it is not clear whether the newly hired personnel have skills that match competencies, such as the ability to work with Special Access Programs, identified in OASD-SO/LIC’s hiring plan. We have previously reported that unless hiring needs are clearly linked with long-term goals, the hiring plan may be incomplete or premature. OASD-SO/LIC’s approach did not fully involve stakeholders. While stakeholder involvement is not statutorily required, another key principle of effective strategic workforce planning is to involve top management, employees, and other stakeholders in developing, communicating, and implementing strategic workforce plans. We found several cases in which OASD-SO/LIC did not involve stakeholders in its key efforts. For example, although OASD-SO/LIC senior officials shared information about the hiring plan with one senior official at SOCOM, several OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM officials stated that OASD-SO/LIC did not communicate the hiring plan’s expectations or strategies more broadly, to involve a full range of OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM officials and other stakeholders, such as USD (P). In another example, when OASD-SO/LIC hired personnel from September 2018 through December 2018, several OASD- SO/LIC and SOCOM officials were unclear about the specific roles and responsibilities of new personnel hired. The hiring plan did not include strategies to address critical competency gaps and identify related personnel requirements. Leading principles of effective strategic workforce planning hold that agencies should develop strategies to address critical skill gaps and systematic personnel requirements processes, which are considered a good human capital practice across government. However, we found that OASD-SO/LIC’s hiring plan did not include completed competency-gap assessments or have procedures in place to periodically reassess personnel requirements. Without a systematic process to periodically assess personnel requirements, OASD-SO/LIC could not determine whether the Army study’s initial estimates were the most efficient choice for the workforce. For example with regard to the legislative affairs positions, OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM officials told us that the Army manpower study’s initial estimate of eight FTEs was too high. OASD-SO/LIC officials eventually hired two FTEs for the legislative affairs office, but the hiring plan did not include a methodology to analyze the workforce and explain why two FTEs would fit within the Army study’s framework. According to OASD- SO/LIC officials, OASD-SO/LIC also did not use a standardized process to assess whether two FTEs would meet its requirements. According to OASD-SO/LIC officials, the hiring plan is the first step in developing an initial framework, and they stated that it lacked implementation details. OASD-SO/LIC officials stated that they anticipate building upon the hiring plan as the current workforce plan evolves over time. In addition, OASD-SO/LIC officials stated that key priorities include strengthening OASD-SO/LIC’s participation and oversight of SOF resources through the POM and fiscal guidance processes. As a result, the hiring plan includes information about new personnel focused on fiscal oversight, such as analyzing the budget in fiscal years 2020 through 2021, but it does not clarify long-term goals, competency gaps, and program results tied to other priorities, such as legislative and acquisition- related functions. Officials from OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM agreed that incorporating key principles in the strategic workforce plan would help them determine the most appropriate size and composition of OASD- SO/LIC’s workforce. Until OASD-SO/LIC completes a comprehensive strategic workforce plan that includes key principles as outlined above, OASD-SO/LIC may not know what gaps exist in skills and competencies, and what their workforce strategies to fill those gaps should be. These issues could put OASD-SO/LIC at risk of hiring personnel who may not adequately meet its needs as defined by section 922. As DOD increasingly relies on SOF, the department has taken steps to implement section 922. Given the expanded statutory authority under section 922, the ASD-SO/LIC has greater authority to oversee and advocate for the SOF enterprise. The ASD-SO/LIC has implemented several actions to clarify and strengthen its oversight roles and responsibilities, and it has many additional planned actions underway. However, without time frames to implement action items and revised or new guidance that clearly articulates the ASD-SO/LIC’s roles and responsibilities with regard to SOCOM and the wider SOF enterprise, these changes may not be fully effective. In addition, without a strategic workforce plan that fully incorporates leading practices to ensure that the department has the right people, in the right place, at the right time, OASD-SO/LIC may not be well prepared to respond to future workload changes and manage its human capital strategically. As OASD-SO/LIC makes progress in its hiring plan, it is important for OASD-SO/LIC to develop a strategic workforce plan to ensure that it appropriately addresses the human-capital challenges of the future and better contributes to the agency’s efforts to meet its missions and goals. We are making three recommendations to the Secretary of Defense: The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict defines time frames for completing action items necessary to implement the Assistant Secretary of Defense for SO/LIC’s expanded section 922 responsibilities. (Recommendation 1) The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict updates existing guidance or develops new guidance to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for SO/LIC and relationships with DOD components that have vested interests in the SOF enterprise—such as the military services, SOCOM, the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, and the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. (Recommendation 2) The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict builds upon its hiring plan by developing a strategic workforce plan that incorporates key principles, such as aligning the plan with long-term mission goals; fully involving stakeholders in developing the plan; and including strategies to address critical competency gaps and identify related personnel requirements. (Recommendation 3) In written comments on the draft of this report, DOD partially concurred with our recommendations. Comments from DOD are summarized below and reprinted in appendix I. DOD also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. DOD partially concurred with the first recommendation that the ASD- SO/LIC define time frames for completing action items necessary to implement the ASD-SO/LIC‘s expanded section 922 responsibilities. In its response, DOD stated that most time frames have been established or the action completed. Additionally, DOD noted that some actions may not be completed because they depend on events, actions or leadership decisions that are outside of OASD-SO/LIC’s control. We agree that some DOD leadership decisions have yet to be made. However, 28 out of 31 already identified actions do not have clear time frames for implementation. Further, time frames can be modified as events change or better information becomes available. As we discuss in the report, establishing time frames with key milestones to track implementation progress are important for agency reform efforts. Without clear time frames, ASD-SO/LIC may not be able to fully execute its service secretary-like authority. DOD partially concurred with the second recommendation that the ASD- SO/LIC update DOD Directive 5111.10 to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the ASD-SO/LIC and relationships with DOD components that have vested interests in the SOF enterprise. DOD is in the process of revising this directive, but DOD noted that the purpose of DOD Directive 5111.10 is to define only specific Department-wide roles and missions for ASD-SO/LIC and is not the appropriate issuance to define ASD-SO/LIC’s relationship with other DOD components in the SOF enterprise. Given that DOD does not believe DOD Directive 5111.10 is the appropriate issuance to clarify ASD-SO/LIC’s relationships with DOD components, we modified our recommendation from focusing solely on updating DOD Directive 5111.10 to updating existing guidance and/or developing new guidance. Updating or developing guidance that clarifies ASD SO/LIC’s relationship with DOD components, such as the military departments, USD (P), and USD (P&R) would likely allow for improved oversight of and collaboration on SOF matters related to personnel, budgetary authority and SAPs. DOD partially concurred with the third recommendation that the ASD- SO/LIC build upon its hiring plan by developing a strategic workforce plan that incorporates key principles, such as aligning the plan with long- term mission goals; fully involving stakeholders in developing the plan; and including strategies to address critical competency gaps and identify related personnel requirements. In its response, DOD agreed that there is room to improve the involvement of stakeholders. In addition, DOD stated that it developed a strategic workforce plan that aligns with long-term mission goals and has identified strategies to address critical competency gaps, including target skillsets. However, as noted in our report, the 10 slide presentation that constitutes the hiring plan lacks details that would be included in a comprehensive workforce plan. For example, the hiring plan did not explain how the hiring needs would be specifically tied to long-term goals, such as National Defense Strategy requirements. Although the hiring plan mentions some skillsets, it does not include a competency gap assessment or assess personnel requirements. As noted in our report, OASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM officials stated that the initial personnel requirements developed by the Army study were inaccurate for several reasons, including the lack of a standardized process to assess personnel requirements. Accordingly, we continue to believe that until OASD-SO/LIC develops a comprehensive strategic workforce plan that includes key principles outlined in our report, OASD- SO/LIC could be at risk of hiring personnel who may not adequately meet its needs to perform the roles and responsibilities of section 922.

  0  Multiple firms have produced cell-cultured meat as part of their research and development. These products appear likely to become available to consumers in coming years. FDA and USDA are the primary agencies responsible for overseeing the safety of the nation's food supply. However, some stakeholders have expressed concern about the agencies' oversight of cell-cultured meat amidst a fragmented federal food safety oversight system. GAO was asked to review federal oversight of cell-cultured meat. This report (1) describes what is known about methods for commercially producing cell-cultured meat, and (2) examines the extent to which FDA and USDA are collaborating to provide regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat. GAO conducted a literature review; reviewed documentation from FDA, USDA, and stakeholder groups; analyzed public comments submitted to the agencies; compared agency efforts with leading practices for interagency collaboration; and conducted site visits to selected cell-cultured meat firms. General information about the process of making cell-cultured meat—food products grown from the cells of livestock, poultry, and seafood—is available. However, no company is commercially producing cell-cultured meat. Specific information about the technology being used, eventual commercial production methods, and composition of the final products is not yet known. The general process contains five phases: biopsy, cell banking, growth, harvest, and food processing (see figure). The technology and methods to be used for commercial production are still in development, and producers, regulators, and consumers do not have clarity about many specifics about the process and final product. For example, it is unclear whether production methods and products will use or contain genetically-engineered cells or medications such as antibiotics. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have begun collaborating on regulatory oversight of cell-cultured meat. For example, in 2019, the agencies signed an interagency agreement and created three working groups to carry out the terms of the agreement. However, the agreement and working groups could more fully incorporate practices to enhance and sustain collaboration, such as defining outcomes. For example, the agreement identifies the development of labeling principles as an outcome, but does not describe how the agencies will track and monitor progress toward this outcome, and the working groups identify a lead agency but not members' roles. Also, agency officials said they decided FDA would oversee cell-cultured seafood other than catfish, but they have not formally announced or documented this decision. Developing and updating written guidance and agreements is also a leading practice for interagency collaboration. By fully incorporating leading practices into their efforts to collaborate, the agencies could minimize potential overlap and fragmentation, use resources in a more efficient manner, and better ensure the public and other key stakeholders have clarity about the agencies' oversight responsibilities. GAO recommends that FDA and USDA more fully incorporate leading practices for effective collaboration in the agencies' interagency agreement. FDA and USDA partially concurred and indicated a willingness to incorporate these practices in a more detailed agreement, which would also meet the intent of the recommendations. The agencies concurred with the four other recommendations.\n","   1  Federal advisory committees provide advice to federal agencies on many topics. As of March 31, 2018, EPA managed 22 such committees. They advise the agency on such issues as developing regulations and managing research programs. Questions have been raised about EPA's process for appointing committee members after recent policy changes affecting who serves on the advisory committees. GAO was asked to review issues related to how EPA appoints advisory committee members. This report examines: (1) EPA's process for appointing advisory committee members, (2) the extent to which EPA followed its process for selecting members from October 2016 through March 2018, and (3) how, if at all, selected characteristics of EPA advisory committees changed after January 2017. GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; reviewed documents from committees that appointed members over this period; analyzed information from the GSA's FACA database; and interviewed agency officials. Based on GAO's review of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) guidance, the agency's established process for appointing advisory committee members involves three main phases: soliciting nominations, evaluating candidates, and obtaining approvals. Each phase involves several steps. For example, a key step for evaluating candidates involves EPA staff's preparing documents that reflect staff recommendations on the best qualified and most appropriate candidates for achieving balanced committee membership, according to EPA guidance. EPA generally followed its established process for most of its 22 advisory committees; however, in fiscal year 2018, EPA did not follow a key step for appointing 20 committee members to two committees GAO reviewed: the EPA Science Advisory Board and Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, which advise the agency on environmental regulatory matters, among other things. The 2018 appointment packets for these two committees did not contain documents reflecting EPA staff rationales for proposed membership, as called for by EPA's established process. EPA developed guidance to implement the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA). By directing officials responsible for appointing committee members to follow a key step in its process to document staff rationales for proposed membership, the agency would have better assurance that it will (1) consistently meet FACA's purpose of encouraging uniform appointment procedures and (2) show how it made appointment decisions to achieve the best qualified and most appropriate candidates for balanced committee membership. EPA also did not consistently ensure that members appointed as special government employees (SGE)—who are expected to provide their best judgment free from conflicts of interest and are required by federal regulations to disclose their financial interests—met federal ethics requirements. For about 23 percent, or 17 of the 74 financial disclosure forms GAO reviewed, an ethics official had not signed and dated that the SGE filing the form was in compliance with federal ethics rules. EPA also did not periodically review its ethics program, as called for by federal regulations, such as through audits or spot-checks, to evaluate the quality of financial disclosure reviews for SGEs. Until EPA's Ethics Office evaluates the quality of financial disclosure reviews of SGEs as part of its periodic review of its ethics program, it will not have reasonable assurance that it will address noncompliance with federal ethics requirements and prevent conflicts of interest on its advisory committees. Based on GAO's review of the U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) FACA database, there were notable changes to selected characteristics of EPA advisory committees (i.e. at least a 20 percentage point difference in the change to a characteristic after January 2017 compared to the period after January 2009). Of the four characteristics GAO reviewed—committee composition, regional affiliation, membership turnover, and number of meetings committees held—one or more of the first three changed notably for four of 18 EPA advisory committees after January 2017. GAO is recommending that EPA direct (1) officials responsible for appointing committee members to follow a key step in its appointment process to document staff rationales for proposed membership and (2) EPA's Ethics Office to evaluate the quality of financial disclosure reviews of SGEs appointed to advisory committees. EPA disagreed with the first and agreed with the second recommendation. GAO continues to believe that both are valid, as discussed in the report.\n","   2  DOD manages a global real-estate portfolio with an almost $1.2 trillion estimated replacement value. Since 2010, DOD has identified climate change as a threat to its operations and installations. In January 2019, DOD stated that the effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to the department's missions, operational plans, and installations. GAO was asked to assess DOD's progress in developing a means to account for potentially damaging weather in its facilities project designs. GAO examined the extent to which DOD has taken steps to incorporate resilience to extreme weather and climate change effects into (1) selected installation master plans and related planning documents, and (2) selected individual installation facilities projects. GAO reviewed DOD documents related to increasing climate resilience, conducting installation master planning, and designing facilities projects. GAO visited or contacted a non-generalizable sample of 23 installations that had been associated with one or more climate vulnerabilities. Department of Defense (DOD) installations have not consistently assessed risks from extreme weather and climate change effects or consistently used projections to anticipate future climate conditions. For example, DOD's 2018 preliminary assessment of extreme weather and climate effects at installations was based on the installations' reported past experiences with extreme weather rather than an analysis of future vulnerabilities based on climate projections. Fifteen of the 23 installations GAO visited or contacted had considered some extreme weather and climate change effects in their plans as required by DOD guidance, but 8 had not. For example, Fort Irwin, California, worked with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to improve stormwater drainage after intense flash flooding caused significant damage to base infrastructure. By contrast, Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, did not include such considerations in its plans, although it is located in an area subject to tropical storms and where further sea level rise is anticipated. GAO also found that most of the installations had not used climate projections, because they lack guidance on how to incorporate projections into their master plans. Not assessing risks or using climate projections in installation planning may expose DOD facilities to greater-than-anticipated damage or degradation as a result of extreme weather or climate-related effects. Eleven of the 23 installations we reviewed had designed one or more individual facilities projects to increase the resilience of the facilities to extreme weather and climate change effects. However, project designs generally did not consider climate projections, according to installation officials. These officials told us that DOD lacks guidance on how to use climate projections that involve multiple future scenarios and different time periods. Until DOD updates its facilities design standards to require installations to consider climate projections in project designs, identify authoritative sources for them to use, and provide guidance on how to use projections, installation project designers may continue to exclude consideration of climate projections from facilities project designs, potentially making investments that are planned without consideration of climate-related risks. GAO is making eight recommendations, including that the military departments work together to update master planning criteria to require an assessment of extreme weather and climate change risks and to incorporate DOD guidance on the use of climate projections into facilities design standards. GAO also recommends that DOD issue guidance on incorporating climate projections into installation master planning and facilities project designs. DOD concurred with all eight of GAO's recommendations.\n","   3  Nursing homes provide care to about 1.4 million nursing home residents—a vulnerable population of elderly and disabled individuals. CMS, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), defines standards nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. GAO was asked to review abuse of residents in nursing homes. Among other objectives, this report: (1) determines the trends and types of abuse in recent years, and (2) evaluates CMS oversight intended to ensure residents are free from abuse. GAO reviewed CMS's policies, analyzed CMS data on abuse deficiencies from 2013 through 2017, the most recent data at the time of our review, and interviewed officials from CMS and state survey agencies in five states, as well as other key stakeholders in those states such as ombudsmen and law enforcement officials. The states were selected for variation in factors such as number of nursing homes and role of other state agencies in abuse investigations. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is responsible for ensuring nursing homes meet federal quality standards, including that residents are free from abuse. CMS enters into agreements with state survey agencies to conduct surveys of the state's homes and to investigate complaints and incidents. GAO analysis of CMS data found that, while relatively rare, abuse deficiencies cited in nursing homes more than doubled, increasing from 430 in 2013 to 875 in 2017, with the largest increase in severe cases. GAO also reviewed a representative sample of abuse deficiency narratives from 2016 through 2017. Physical and mental/verbal abuse occurred most often in nursing homes, followed by sexual abuse, and staff were more often the perpetrators of the abuse deficiencies cited. CMS cannot readily access information on abuse or perpetrator type in its data and, therefore, lacks key information critical to taking appropriate actions. GAO also found gaps in CMS oversight, including: Gaps in CMS processes that can result in delayed and missed referrals. Federal law requires nursing home staff to immediately report to law enforcement and the state survey agency reasonable suspicions of a crime that results in serious bodily injury to a resident. However, there is no equivalent requirement that the state survey agency make a timely referral for complaints it receives directly or through surveys it conducts. CMS also does not conduct oversight to ensure that state survey agencies are correctly referring abuse cases to law enforcement. Insufficient information collected on facility-reported incidents. CMS has not issued guidance on what nursing homes should include when they self-report abuse incidents to the state survey agencies. Officials from all of the state survey agencies in GAO's review said the facility-reported incidents can lack information needed to prioritize investigations and may result in state survey agencies not responding as quickly as needed. GAO is making six recommendations, including that CMS: require state survey agencies to submit data on abuse and perpetrator type; require state survey agencies to immediately refer to law enforcement any suspicion of a crime; and develop guidance on what abuse information nursing homes should self-report. HHS concurred with all of GAO's recommendations and identified actions it will take to implement them.\n","   4  Decades of defense activities at DOE's Idaho National Laboratory produced two forms of waste that EM has managed as HLW: liquid SBW and granular calcine waste. Under an agreement with the state, DOE must treat the waste to prepare it for removal from Idaho by 2035. Construction on the IWTU, EM's facility to treat such waste, was completed in 2012, but initial testing of the SBW treatment process revealed design problems. EM has since been working to reengineer the IWTU. Total project construction and reengineering expenditures have reached nearly $1 billion as of February 2019. GAO was asked to review EM's efforts to treat and dispose of the SBW and calcine waste. This report examines (1) the extent to which EM's management of the IWTU follows selected project management best practices; (2) challenges EM faces in disposing of the SBW; and (3) challenges EM faces in treating and disposing of the calcine waste. GAO reviewed agency documents and IWTU project data from March 2017 through February 2018, analyzed EM project management efforts against selected project management best practices for cost and schedule, and interviewed DOE officials. The Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) has not fully followed selected project management best practices in managing the reengineering of the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit (IWTU), shown in the figure, to treat 900,000 gallons of liquid sodium-bearing waste (SBW) that must be solidified for disposal. EM's cost and schedule estimates for IWTU reengineering did not fully meet selected best practices for cost (i.e., did not account for all costs) and schedule estimates (e.g., did not have a valid critical path). For example, EM did not follow best practices for a comprehensive cost estimate because EM did not include both government and contractor costs over the entire project. As of February 2019, EM has experienced approximately $64 million in added costs and a more than 1-year delay in IWTU reengineering. Without fully following best practices for cost and schedule estimates, EM is at risk of future cost overruns and delays in meeting its target disposal milestones. Based on GAO's review of EM documents, EM faces challenges with its plans for SBW disposal at its preferred disposal site, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), an underground repository for waste contaminated by nuclear elements, near Carlsbad, New Mexico. These challenges include a statutory prohibition on the disposal of high-level waste (HLW) at WIPP. Further, EM does not have a strategy or timeline to address these challenges or to identify an alternative disposal pathway. Without such a strategy or timeline, EM risks not meeting its commitments with Idaho to prepare the SBW for removal from the state by 2035. EM faces challenges implementing its selected technology to further treat 1.2 million gallons of granular calcine waste and selecting a potential waste disposal pathway. For example, DOE has identified challenges with retrofitting the IWTU for calcine waste treatment. As a result, EM is deferring further development of its plans to treat the calcine waste. EM officials said that the agency is making progress toward calcine waste disposal by testing options for removing the waste from its storage bins, a precursor to treating or packaging the waste for disposal. However, EM does not have a strategy or timeline for determining its next steps for the treatment and disposal of calcine waste. Such a strategy could help EM in seeking alternatives to its selected treatment technology and provide assurance that it will meet its commitments with Idaho for removing calcine waste from the state by the end of 2035. GAO is making five recommendations, including that DOE develop a strategy for the disposal of the waste. DOE generally agreed with all of these recommendations.\n","   5  Federal agencies publish on average 3,700 proposed rules yearly and are generally required to provide interested persons (commenters) an opportunity to comment on these rules. In recent years, some high-profile rulemakings have received extremely large numbers of comments, raising questions about how agencies manage the identity information associated with comments. While the APA does not require the disclosure of identifying information from a commenter, agencies may choose to collect this information. This testimony summarizes GAO's June 2019 report on public comment posting practices (GAO-19-483). In that report, GAO examined (1) the identity information collected by comment websites; (2) the guidance agencies have related to the identity of commenters; (3) how 10 selected agencies treat identity information; and (4) the extent to which the selected agencies clearly communicate their practices associated with identity information. The 10 agencies were selected on the basis of the volume of public comments they received on rulemakings. For this testimony, GAO obtained updates on the status of recommendations made to the selected agencies. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) governs the process by which many federal agencies develop and issue regulations, which includes the public comment process (see figure below). In June 2019, GAO found that Regulations.gov and agency-specific comment websites collect some identity information—such as name, email, or address—from commenters who choose to provide it during the public comment process. The APA does not require commenters to disclose identity information when submitting comments. In addition, agencies have no obligation under the APA to verify the identity of such parties during the rulemaking process, and all selected agencies accept anonymous comments in practice. GAO found in the June 2019 report that seven of 10 selected agencies have some internal guidance associated with the identity of commenters, but the substance of this guidance varies. This reflects the differences in the way that the selected agencies handle commenter identity information internally. GAO also found that the selected agencies' practices for posting public comments to comment websites vary considerably, particularly for duplicate comments (identical or near-identical comment text but varied identity information). For example, one agency posts a single example of duplicate comments and indicates the total number of comments received, but only the example is available to public users of Regulations.gov. In contrast, other agencies post all comments individually. As a result, identity information submitted with comments is inconsistently presented on public websites. The APA allows agencies discretion in how they post comments, but GAO found that some of the selected agencies do not clearly communicate their practices for how comments and identity information are posted. GAO's key practices for transparently reporting government data state that federal government websites should disclose data sources and limitations to help public users make informed decisions about how to use the data. If not, public users of the comment websites could reach inaccurate conclusions about who submitted a particular comment, or how many individuals commented on an issue. In June 2019, GAO made recommendations to eight of the selected agencies regarding implementing and communicating public comment posting policies. The agencies generally agreed with the recommendations and identified actions they planned to take in response. Since the June 2019 report, one agency has implemented GAO's recommendation and seven agencies have identified additional planned actions.\n","   6  Since 2000, there has been substantial growth in Medicare payments for hospice services and the number of Medicare beneficiaries using hospice. This growth has been accompanied by an increase in the number of providers (primarily an increase in for-profit providers), reaching approximately 4,500 providers by 2017. GAO was asked to review aspects of Medicare's hospice program. This report, among other things, (1) compares quality scores and other potential indicators of quality for for-profit and non-profit hospices; and (2) examines opportunities for strengthening CMS's oversight of hospice providers. GAO analyzed CMS data on hospice care for 2014 through 2017—the latest years for which full-year data were available at the time of GAO's analysis—and reviewed research on hospice care. GAO interviewed CMS officials, researchers, provider associations, a survey agency association, and a non-generalizable sample of hospice providers selected in part through referrals from other stakeholders. GAO also reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, documents, and enforcement data. Medicare's hospice benefit provides palliative care to beneficiaries with terminal illnesses and a life expectancy of 6 months or less. GAO's review of 2017 data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) found that for-profit and non-profit hospices had, on average, similar scores on CMS's current quality measures that indicate hospice performance in areas such as pain assessment and discussion of beneficiary treatment preferences. However, for-profits were more often among the subset of providers with the lowest scores on certain quality measures GAO reviewed. In addition to analyzing providers' scores on CMS quality measures, GAO analyzed provider performance on other indicators, identified by researchers, that could signal quality issues and found performance varied among for-profit and non-profit hospices. One of the other quality indicators GAO analyzed was the rate of beneficiaries discharged from hospice prior to death, which in some cases could indicate dissatisfaction with care leading to the beneficiary's decision to leave the hospice provider. In addition, GAO examined the number of provider visits to give medical and emotional support within the last few days of a beneficiary's life. With regard to these indicators, for 2017, GAO found the following, among other things: 472 hospice providers (462 for-profits and 10 non-profits) had a high rate of discharging beneficiaries prior to death (50 percent or more were discharged). According to research, a high discharge rate could, in some cases, be an indicator of poor quality of care or of provider misuse of the benefit, in that the hospice may be enrolling beneficiares who are not eligible for hospice care. 83 providers (80 for-profits and 3 non-profits) did not have hospice staff (such as nurses, physicians, or nurse practitioners) visit beneficiaries within the last 3 days of their life—a critical time in providing quality care, according to researchers GAO interviewed. CMS's oversight of the quality of care provided by hospice providers consists primarily of inspections—called surveys—of hospice providers. GAO found that, while CMS instructs surveyors to review previous survey findings and complaints, CMS does not instruct surveyors to use information on providers' performance on quality measures or other potential indicators of quality as part of the survey process. For example, CMS does not instruct surveyors to consider whether a hospice provided staff visits during beneficiaries' last week of life. According to research, this information could be used to enhance the survey process. GAO also found that CMS is limited to one enforcement option—termination of the Medicare provider agreement—which CMS uses rarely and generally only when providers fail to correct within the required time frame the most serious violations of federal health and safety requirements. According to two researchers, additional remedies, such as civil monetary penalties, could enhance CMS's oversight by addressing performance problems that do not merit termination and incentivize agencies to improve quality of care. CMS uses a range of remedies for other provider types, such as home health agencies and nursing homes, but lacks authority to impose such additional sanctions on hospices. CMS should incorporate the use of additional information that could be used to identify quality of care issues into its survey process for hospice oversight. Congress should consider giving CMS authority to establish additional enforcement remedies for hospices that do not meet federal health and safety requirements. The Department of Health and Human Services concurred with GAO's recommendation.\n","   7  Third-party providers, such as paid tax return preparers and tax preparation software providers, greatly impact IRS’s administration of the tax system. If these third parties do not properly secure taxpayers’ personal and financial information, taxpayers will be vulnerable to identity theft refund fraud and their sensitive personal information will be at risk of unauthorized disclosure. IRS estimates that it paid out at least $110 million in identity theft tax refund fraud during 2017, and at least $1.6 billion in identity theft tax refund fraud during 2016. GAO was asked to review IRS’s efforts to track, monitor, and deter theft of taxpayer information from third parties. Among other things, this report assesses what is known about the taxpayer information security requirements for the systems used by third-party providers, IRS’s processes for monitoring compliance with these requirements, and IRS’s requirements for third-party security incident reporting. GAO analyzed IRS’s information security requirements, standards, and guidance for third-party providers and compared them to relevant laws, regulations, and leading practices, such as NIST guidance and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government . GAO reviewed IRS’s monitoring procedures and its requirements and processes for third-party reporting of security incidents, and compared them to Internal Control Standards and GAO’s A Framework for Managing Fraud Risk in Federal Programs . GAO also interviewed IRS and tax industry group officials. Federal law and guidance require that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the sensitive financial and taxpayer information that resides on its systems. However, taxpayer information held by third-party providers—such as paid tax return preparers and tax preparation software providers—generally falls outside of these requirements, according to IRS officials. In 2018, about 90 percent of individual taxpayers had their tax returns electronically filed by paid preparers or used tax preparation software to prepare and file their own returns. IRS seeks to help safeguard electronic tax return filing for various types of third-party providers through requirements under its Authorized e-file Provider program. However, IRS’s efforts do not provide assurance that taxpayers’ information is being adequately protected. Paid Preparers. IRS has not developed minimum information security requirements for the systems used by paid preparers or Authorized e-file Providers. According to IRS’s Office of Chief Counsel, IRS does not have the explicit authority to regulate security for these systems. Instead, the Internal Revenue Code gives IRS broad authority to administer and supervise the internal revenue laws. The Department of the Treasury has previously requested additional authority to regulate the competency of all paid preparers; GAO has also suggested that Congress consider granting IRS this authority. Congress has not yet provided such authority. Neither the Department of the Treasury request nor the GAO suggestion included granting IRS authority to regulate the security of paid preparers’ systems. Having such authority would enable IRS to establish minimum requirements. Further, having explicit authority to establish security standards for Authorized e-file Providers’ systems may help IRS better ensure the protection of taxpayers’ information. Tax Software Providers. As part of a public-private partnership between IRS and the tax preparation industry, 15 tax software providers voluntarily adhere to a set of about 140 information security controls developed using guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). However, these controls are not required, and these providers represent only about one-third of all tax software providers. Additionally, IRS established six security, privacy, and business standards for providers of software that allows individuals to prepare their own tax returns (as opposed to software that paid preparers use). However, IRS has not substantially updated these standards since 2010, and they are, at least in part, outdated. For example, IRS cites an outdated encryption standard that NIST recommends not using due to its many known weaknesses. A key factor contributing to missed opportunities to address third-party cybersecurity is IRS’s lack of centralized leadership. Consequently, IRS is less able to ensure that third-party providers adequately protect taxpayers’ information, which may result in identity theft refund fraud. IRS monitors compliance with its electronic tax return filing program requirements for those paid preparers who electronically file returns; however, IRS’s monitoring has a limited focus on cybersecurity issues. For example, the monitoring techniques largely focus on physical security (e.g., locked filing cabinets) rather than verifying that preparers have an information security policy consistent with NIST-recommended controls. Without effective monitoring of cybersecurity controls, IRS has limited assurance that those paid preparers’ systems have adequate controls in place to protect clients’ data. IRS recently began collecting information on high-risk security incidents, such as hackers infiltrating third-party provider systems. Reported incidents increased from 2017 to 2018, the only years for which IRS has data. However, IRS does not have a full picture of the scope of incidents because of inconsistent reporting requirements, including no reporting requirements for paid preparers. GAO suggests that Congress consider providing IRS with explicit authority to establish security requirements for paid preparers’ and Authorized e-file Providers’ systems. GAO is also making eight recommendations, including that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Develop a governance structure or other form of centralized leadership to coordinate all aspects of IRS’s efforts to protect taxpayer information while at third-party providers. Require all tax software providers to adhere to prescribed information security controls. Regularly review and update security standards for tax software providers. Update IRS’s monitoring programs to include basic cybersecurity issues. Standardize incident reporting requirements for all types of third-party providers. IRS agreed with three recommendations, including the above recommendations to regularly review and update security standards for tax software providers, and standardize incident reporting requirements. IRS disagreed with five recommendations—including the other three listed above—generally citing the lack of clear and explicit authority it would need to establish security requirements for the information systems of paid preparers and Authorized e-file Providers. GAO believes that IRS can implement these recommendations without additional statutory authority.\n","   8  The CCDF is administered as a block grant to the states by OCC, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Recent reports by the HHS Office of the Inspector General show that OCC's monitoring of CCDF state program-integrity efforts remains a challenge. CCDF has also been designated as a program susceptible to significant improper payments, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget. GAO was asked to review CCDF program-integrity efforts. This report discusses, among other things, the extent to which OCC provides oversight of (1) states' CCDF program-integrity activities, including encouraging that all requested information is included within State Plans; and (2) improper-payment risks and relevant corrective actions in states' CCDF programs. GAO analyzed 51 approved CCDF State Plans, including from the District of Columbia, for the fiscal years 2019–2021 grant period. GAO also reviewed OCC policies and procedures and compared them to relevant laws, regulations, and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government , and interviewed relevant federal officials. The Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) provided states more than $8 billion in federal funds in fiscal year 2019. The Office of Child Care (OCC) oversees the integrity of the CCDF, which subsidizes child care for low-income families. A key part of OCC's oversight includes reviewing and approving State Plans. OCC requested but did not require states to describe in their State Plans the results of their program-integrity activities, which describe the processes that states use to identify fraud risk. Further, OCC has not defined or communicated what information it considers to be the “results” of program-integrity activities to the states and its own staff. Without defining and communicating its informational needs, OCC may continue to lack quality information that could help ensure states' accountability over their program-integrity activities. OCC oversees states' improper payment risks through a process that includes a requirement for states to submit corrective action plans (CAP) when they estimate their annual payment error rates are at or above 10 percent. Since 2013, seven states have submitted 14 CAPs. These CAPs describe states' proposed actions for reducing improper payments. However, OCC does not have documented criteria to guide its review and approval of the CAPs to ensure the proposed corrective actions are aimed at root causes of improper payments and are effectively implemented. Without developing this guidance, OCC does not have assurance that proposed corrective actions are specifically aimed at root causes of improper payments, leaving the CCDF program at continued risk of improper payments. GAO is making nine recommendations, including that OCC define and communicate its informational needs on the results of states' program-integrity activities, and that OCC develop criteria to guide the review of CAPs to ensure that proposed corrective actions are aimed at root causes of improper payments and are effectively implemented. HHS concurred with our recommendations and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate.\n","   9  PMIAA requires OMB to adopt program management standards and guidelines government-wide; OPM is to establish new—or revise existing—occupational standards for program and project management. PMIAA includes a provision for GAO, no later than 3 years after the enactment of the act, to issue a report examining the implementation and effectiveness of certain provisions of the act on federal program and project management. This report (1) describes steps taken by OMB, OPM, and agencies to implement PMIAA; (2) assesses OMB's efforts to address issues on GAO's High-Risk List using PMIAA; and (3) examines the extent to which OMB provided methods for agencies to measure and assess the results of PMIAA. GAO reviewed documents from and conducted interviews with OMB and OPM. GAO surveyed all 24 CFO Act agencies, and selected five agencies to illustrate implementation efforts. GAO also interviewed subject matter specialists from academia and the private sector regarding their views on how program and project management practices applied to PMIAA. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has begun to implement all requirements of the Program Management Improvement Accountabilitiy Act of 2016 (PMIAA), but further efforts are needed to fully implement the law. OMB released its 5-year strategic plan for PMIAA and developed program management standards. However, the standards are not detailed compared with accepted program and project management standards, and OMB's governance structure is insufficient for developing and maintaining these standards over time. In 2019, OMB conducted ten reviews of agency program portfolios—organized groupings of programs whose coordination in implementation enables agencies to achieve their objectives. Each review addressed one or two portfolios per agency. Further, OMB's required portfolio reviews of high-risk areas were limited to only five out of 35 areas on GAO's High-Risk List. OMB could establish measures to track agencies' progress. Although not required by PMIAA, this is a good practice for demonstrating improvement. As required by PMIAA, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) developed competencies for program and project managers and updated the program management job series. Further, OPM is developing a career path for program and project managers by the end of 2019. OPM also plans to create a unique job identifier code in 2020 so that agencies can more completely identify their program management workforce. The Program Management Policy Council (PMPC), established by PMIAA and chaired by OMB's Deputy Director for Management, met for the first time in September 2018 and met twice in 2019 to discuss PMIAA implementation with Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies. All CFO Act agencies designated a Program Management Improvement Officer to participate in the PMPC. However, the PMPC has neither addressed GAO high-risk areas nor advised OMB on how to address high-risk areas, as required by the PMIAA. GAO is making eight recommendations that OMB further develop the standards to include more detail, create a governance structure for program management standards, hold meetings on all High-Risk List areas, and establish measures to track agencies' progress in program management. OMB neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendations and stated that it would consider them when making future updates to its program management policies and guidance.\n","  10  Nationwide, about 1.4 million elderly or disabled individuals receive care in more than 15,500 nursing homes. CMS, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), defines standards nursing homes must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Nursing home residents often have physical or cognitive limitations that can leave them particularly vulnerable to abuse. Abuse of nursing home residents can occur in many forms—including physical, mental, verbal, and sexual—and can be committed by staff, residents, or others in the nursing home. Any incident of abuse is a serious occurrence and can result in potentially devastating consequences for residents, including lasting mental anguish, serious injury, or death. This statement summarizes GAO's June 2019 report, GAO-19-433 . Specifically, it describes: (1) the trends and types of abuse in recent years, and (2) CMS's oversight intended to ensure residents are free from abuse. It also includes a brief summary of findings and recommendations from this June 2019 report and prior GAO reports that examined the health and welfare of the elderly in multiple settings, and the status, as of November 2019, of HHS's efforts to implement the recommendations GAO made. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is responsible for ensuring nursing homes meet federal quality standards, including that residents are free from abuse. CMS enters into agreements with state survey agencies to conduct surveys of the state's homes and to investigate complaints and incidents. GAO's June 2019 report found that, while abuse deficiencies cited in nursing homes were relatively rare from 2013 through 2017, they more than doubled during that time, increasing from 430 in 2013 to 875 in 2017, with the largest increase in severe cases. In light of the increased number and severity of abuse deficiencies, it is imperative that CMS have strong nursing home oversight in place to protect residents from abuse. However, GAO found oversight gaps that may limit the agency's ability to do so. Specifically, GAO found: (1) Information on abuse and perpetrator types is not readily available. CMS's data do not allow for the type of abuse or perpetrator to be readily identified by the agency. Specifically, CMS does not require the state survey agencies to record abuse and perpetrator type and, when this information is recorded, it cannot be easily analyzed by CMS. GAO made a recommendation that CMS require state survey agencies to submit data on abuse and perpetrator type and HHS concurred. As of November 2019, HHS had not implemented the recommendation. (2) Facility-reported incidents lack key information. Despite federal law requiring nursing homes to self-report allegations of abuse and covered individuals to report reasonable suspicions of crimes against residents, CMS has not provided guidance to nursing homes on what information they should include in facility-reported incidents, contributing to a lack of information for state survey agencies and delays in their investigations. GAO made a recommendation that CMS develop guidance on what abuse information nursing homes should self-report and HHS concurred. As of November 2019, HHS had not implemented the recommendation. (3) Gaps exist in the CMS process for state survey agency referrals to law enforcement. GAO found gaps in CMS's process for referring incidents of abuse to law enforcement. These gaps may limit CMS's ability to ensure that nursing homes meet federal requirements for residents to be free from abuse. Specifically, GAO identified issues related to (1) referring abuse to law enforcement in a timely manner, (2) tracking abuse referrals, (3) defining what it means to substantiate an allegation of abuse—that is, the determination by the state survey agency that evidence supports the abuse allegation, and (4) sharing information with law enforcement. GAO made four recommendations to address these gaps and HHS concurred. As of November 2019, HHS had not implemented these recommendations.\n","  11  VA receives billions of dollars per year to provide health care and disability compensation to promote the wellness of veterans with service-connected conditions. VA studies veterans' health through research and assesses changes in service-connected conditions through its reevaluation process. GAO was asked to review VA's efforts to study and gauge the health outcomes of veterans with service-connected conditions. This report examines the extent to which (1) veterans used VA health care services to treat service-connected conditions, and what is known about their health outcomes; (2) VA uses information on reevaluations to help manage the program; and (3) VA's procedures position it to determine when to conduct a reevaluation. GAO reviewed fiscal year 2018 VA health care data; selected studies; VA data on completed reevaluations from fiscal years 2013-2018; and relevant federal laws, regulations, and program guidance. GAO also interviewed staff at four VA regional offices (selected for variation in claims workload and location) and VA officials at the agency's central office. In fiscal year 2018, about 54 percent of veterans receiving Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability compensation had at least one VA outpatient visit to treat an injury or illness that VA deemed was incurred or aggravated during military service (i.e., a service-connected condition). However, the health outcomes of veterans with service-connected conditions, such as changes in the severity of symptoms or the incidence of mortality, are not well understood. Information about health outcomes is central to ensuring veterans' wellness and assessing improvement in their disability status. According to VA researchers GAO spoke with and academic studies GAO reviewed, various challenges have limited research on this population. For example, data reside in different VA systems and use different identifiers for medical conditions, hindering use of the data. While VA has begun to consider ways to analyze health outcomes, it has not yet established a plan for this effort, including the scope, specific activities, and timeframes for addressing the identified research challenges. VA does not glean information from the results of reevaluations to help manage its disability compensation program. Disability reevaluations help VA gauge whether veterans' service-connected conditions have changed, and whether disability compensation should be modified to reflect those changes (see figure). However, VA does not fully use key management information, such as: trends in how frequently certain conditions are reevaluated, including those required by VA regulations to be reevaluated; and outcomes of reevaluation decisions for individual conditions (i.e., whether conditions worsened or improved). Both trend and outcome information could help VA better target its resources toward reevaluating conditions more likely to change. VA recently updated its procedures manual to specify which staff may determine whether a veteran's condition should be reevaluated, but has not clearly defined skill sets and training needed to consistently implement these procedures. Specifically, the updated procedures do not indicate the knowledge, skills, and abilities staff need to determine when to conduct reevaluations. Further, VA has not ensured that training aligns with these needed skillsets. Without improving procedures and training, VA is at risk of conducting unnecessary reevaluations and burdening veterans. GAO is making five recommendations, including that VA develop a plan to address challenges to studying health outcomes, use information on reevaluations to improve program management, and improve procedures and training for reevaluations. VA agreed with two recommendations and agreed in principle with the other three, but its proposed actions do not fully address GAO's concerns.\n","  12  As of March 2018, more than 1.2 million foreign students in the United States were enrolled in 8,774 schools certified by SEVP. ICE is responsible for managing SEVP, which certifies schools to enroll foreign students. Various ICE offices have a role in preventing, detecting, and responding to potential fraud in the program. GAO was asked to review potential vulnerabilities to fraud in SEVP. GAO examined, among other things, the extent to which ICE (1) implemented controls to address fraud risks in the school certification and recertification processes and (2) implemented fraud risk controls related to DSO training. GAO analyzed ICE policies and documentation, including fraud risk guidance and procedures for school certification and recertification; analyzed 2013 through 2017 recertification data; and interviewed officials from five ICE field offices that GAO selected based on their experience investigating program fraud. GAO also interviewed officials from 17 selected schools located near these ICE field offices. This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in November 2018. Information that DHS deemed sensitive has been omitted. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has identified several fraud risks to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). As shown in the figure below, these include risks associated with school owners and designated school officials (DSO) who help ICE oversee students in the program. These fraud risks may occur as schools apply to become SEVP-certified, accept foreign students, and apply for recertification every 2 years. ICE has implemented controls to address fraud risks related to school certification, but long-standing delays in recertifying these schools exacerbate fraud risks. By statute and regulation, ICE must conduct recertification reviews every 2 years to ensure that schools continue to meet program requirements—an important fraud risk control. Between 2013 and 2017, ICE recertified about 12,900 schools. However, according to ICE officials, they have been unable to meet the 2-year time frame and, as of June 2018, had 3,281 recertification petitions waiting for review. To help manage its queue, ICE has lengthened the period between recertification reviews by extending schools' certification expiration dates by 180 days, which is inconsistent with its regulation and may allow fraudulent schools to operate longer without detection. Although ICE is taking steps to increase resources for recertification, it is unclear whether these steps will ensure recertification is conducted consistently with ICE regulations. ICE relies on DSOs to, among other things, update and maintain foreign-student data in ICE's foreign-student information system and report suspected fraud to ICE. However, ICE does not provide DSOs with training that addresses fraud risks to the program. In June 2018, ICE officials stated that they plan to develop this fraud training for DSOs, but do not have documented plans or timelines for when it would be completed. By developing these plans, the agency would be better positioned to ensure that DSOs receive the training needed to address potential fraud in the program. GAO is making seven recommendations, including that ICE (1) notify schools 180 days prior to the 2-year certification expiration date, as required, and evaluate whether additional resources for recertification are needed, and (2) develop a plan to implement fraud-specific training for DSOs. ICE concurred with all of GAO's recommendations.\n","  13  The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Zika virus a public health emergency of international concern in February 2016. According to WHO, as of March 2017, 79 countries and territories—including 48 in the Western Hemisphere—reported evidence of ongoing Zika transmission. In April 2016, USAID and State repurposed $215 million for Zika from funds appropriated for Ebola. Subsequently, the Zika Response and Preparedness Appropriations Act, 2016, provided over $175 million in supplemental funding to USAID and State to support Zika response efforts overseas. The act also included a provision for GAO to review the status of USAID and State actions to respond to Zika. In March 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention downgraded its international travel warning for Zika. This report examines (1) the status of USAID and State funding for U.S. Zika response overseas, (2) activities supported by these funds, and (3) implementation challenges, if any, and responses to any challenges. GAO reviewed information from U.S. agencies and met with U.S. and host country officials in Washington, D.C. GAO also conducted fieldwork in a nongeneralizable sample of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean where agencies implemented key response activities. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of State (State) obligated $385 million of the total $390 million available for international Zika response and disbursed $264 million as of September 2018. USAID obligated 95 percent of the total funding. USAID and State provided some country information to Congress but did not provide, or take steps to track, funding on a country basis. According to USAID officials, tracking funding information by country would be helpful in the future. The ability to compile funding by country when responding to future infectious disease outbreaks would enable USAID to provide additional information to key decision makers to better support spending oversight and inform budgetary and planning decisions. In response to the Zika outbreak, USAID and State supported a broad range of activities overseas, including mosquito control, research efforts, and medical evacuations. In one activity, USAID implementing partners monitored mosquito populations; in another, they researched methods to reduce Zika virus transmission rates. USAID implementing partners reported various outputs from selected activities. For example, an implementing partner reported that its awareness campaign on Zika prevention reached more than 5 million people. USAID faced sustainability and timeliness challenges in implementing its Zika response. According to agency and other officials, one-time funding and a short time frame posed a challenge related to sustainability of Zika response activities. In response, USAID worked to align activities with those of host governments and other organizations so they could continue in the long term. However, USAID's emergency response planning did not fully address the challenge of timely implementation of response activities in countries without bilateral USAID health programs. Twenty-two of 26 countries with Zika response activities did not have bilateral USAID health programs when the Zika outbreak began. As a result, response activities took additional time to deploy in some countries where USAID first had to establish relationships with key host country officials. Although USAID developed an infectious disease response plan in 2018, the plan does not provide guidance on how to address the timely implementation challenge in countries without bilateral health programs. By improving its planning, such as by adding such guidance in its 2018 plan, USAID would be better positioned to respond quickly to future disease outbreaks. USAID should (1) take steps to ensure it is able to compile funding information by country for future infectious disease emergency responses and (2) take steps to improve its infectious disease response planning. USAID concurred with GAO's recommendations.\n","  14  The United States, which relies on imports for most of the seafood it consumes, imported about $40 billion in fishery products in 2018. Seafood imports often involve complex supply chains, which may include forced labor. A 2017 United Nations report estimated that there are 24.9 million people in forced labor around the world, 12 percent of whom work in the agriculture and fishing sectors. Section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended in 2016, prohibits the importation of goods, including seafood, produced or manufactured, wholly or in part, in any foreign country by forced labor, among other things. GAO was asked to review CBP's enforcement of section 307. This report examines (1) the process CBP uses to enforce section 307 for seafood imports and the results of its civil enforcement actions; and (2) the external sources of information CBP uses to help carry out enforcement of section 307 for seafood imports and stakeholder perspectives on CBP's communication of its information needs. GAO reviewed laws and CBP documents pertaining to section 307 enforcement and interviewed officials from CBP, other federal agencies, and 18 NGO stakeholders. GAO selected NGOs with various goals and missions related to seafood and forced labor. The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses a four-phase process to enforce section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, which prohibits imports produced with forced labor, including seafood. CBP's Forced Labor Division, established in 2018, largely carries out this process. In phase 1, CBP assesses leads when deciding to initiate a case involving potential forced labor. In phase 2, CBP investigates cases using a variety of information to determine whether evidentiary standards have been met. In phase 3, CBP reviews information for legal sufficiency and, in phase 4, may take action at a port of entry to detain imports in violation by issuing a withhold release order. Between 2016 and March 2020, CBP issued one order for seafood, prohibiting tuna shipments from a specific fishing vessel from entering U.S. commerce. CBP uses information from external sources to help enforce section 307 for seafood imports but may miss opportunities to obtain key information from stakeholders. CBP officials said they use media reports and information from federal agencies and stakeholders to develop forced labor cases. For example, CBP initiated the case that resulted in the seafood order based partly on media reports and investigated it using vessel data from the Department of Commerce. CBP officials said that stakeholders such as nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) often have firsthand accounts of forced labor—valuable information for investigations. However, most stakeholders told GAO that they do not have a clear understanding of the information CBP needs to investigate seafood cases because CBP has not communicated such information. For example, CBP's website provides general information about what individuals can submit if forced labor is suspected but does not provide specific types of information that could be useful. With better communication to stakeholders about the types of information it needs to develop forced labor cases, CBP may be able to improve its enforcement efforts. GAO recommends that CBP better communicate to stakeholders the types of information stakeholders could collect and submit to CBP to help the agency initiate and investigate forced labor cases related to seafood and, as appropriate, other goods. CBP agreed with GAO's recommendation.\n","  15  As DOD increased its reliance on special operations forces, SOCOM's budget has increased from $5.2 billion in 2005 to $12.3 billion in 2018. Section 922 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 included provisions to enhance the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict's responsibilities to be similar to those of a military department secretary regarding the organization, training, and equipping of special operations forces. The Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the fiscal year 2018 NDAA included a provision for GAO to assess DOD's actions in response to section 922. This report assesses (1) the extent to which DOD has identified and taken actions to implement section 922; (2) what, if any, challenges it faces in completing implementation; and (3) the extent to which its hiring approach for the office of the ASD-SO/LIC has incorporated strategic workforce planning principles. GAO reviewed relevant documents and interviewed DOD officials. Since 2017 the Department of Defense (DOD) has made recommendations, developed actions, and taken steps to address requirements in section 922 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 to expand the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict's (ASD-SO/LIC) roles and responsibilities. DOD officials noted that they have taken an incremental implementation approach to addressing section 922. In 2018, DOD identified 166 recommendations to change the ASD-SO/LIC's oversight of special operations forces (SOF). These recommendations were used to develop 87 actions that were necessary to implement section 922. Since February 2019, DOD has implemented 56 of these actions. For example, the Deputy Secretary of Defense approved a new Special Operations Policy and Oversight Council directive that identified the ASD-SO/LIC as the lead for that council. The Deputy Secretary of Defense also delegated the ASD-SO/LIC with authority to approve waivers to hire civilian personnel during a civilian hiring freeze. Although the office of the ASD-SO/LIC has taken many actions to implement section 922, DOD faces two key challenges in completing its implementation of the ASD-SO/LIC's new roles and responsibilities: Lack of time frames . As of February 2019, 28 out of 31 unimplemented actions associated with section 922 did not have clear time frames for implementation. According to ASD-SO/LIC and U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) officials, they did not prioritize establishing time frames because they took an incremental approach to implementing actions and addressed them on a case-by-case basis. Without clear time frames for implementation, ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM may be less effective in implementing section 922. Unclear guidance . Current guidance about ASD-SO/LIC responsibilities is outdated: for example, it states that the ASD-SO/LIC shall report directly to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy. However, section 922 states that special operation forces-related administrative matters are managed directly by the Secretary of Defense to the ASD-SO/LIC. The special operations force enterprise is a complex system, and unless roles and responsibilities are clarified in guidance, other DOD stakeholders, such as the military services, may not know the extent of the ASD-SO/LIC's and SOCOM's authorities and responsibilities. DOD officials expressed some concerns that until these matters are clarified in guidance, it will remain unclear whether the ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM should work together—for example, on personnel issues—and how their relationships with stakeholders with oversight authority will be managed. DOD partially concurred, and based on its comments, GAO modified one recommendation. The office of the ASD-SO/LIC has made efforts to develop a workforce plan, including commissioning a manpower study and taking steps to develop a hiring plan; however, these efforts do not fully incorporate some leading principles for a strategic workforce plan. For example, ASD-SO/LIC did not share the hiring plan with its staff, including key officials from the office of the ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM. Without completing a comprehensive strategic workforce plan that includes key principles, the office of the ASD-SO/LIC may not know what gaps exist in skills and competencies in order to develop effective workforce strategies to fill those gaps. These issues could put the office of the ASD-SO/LIC at risk of hiring personnel who may not adequately meet its needs as defined by section 922. GAO is making three recommendations to DOD to establish time frames for section 922 actions; update applicable guidance to clarify roles and responsibilities for the ASD-SO/LIC and SOCOM; and develop a strategic workforce plan that incorporates key principles. DOD partially concurred with the recommendations and GAO continues to believe the recommendations are valid, as discussed in the report. GAO also modified one recommendation to address DOD concerns regarding its applicability.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(\n","    tabulate(\n","        zip(\n","

This report examines (1) the extent to which FDA and USDA have assessed the safety of food products, (2) the extent to which FDA and USDA have designed a risk-based inspection approach: and the extent of actions taken to improve oversight of food safety; and actions taken to improve oversight of food safety; and actions taken to improve oversight of food safety; and actions taken to improve oversight; and oversight; and results; and challenges; and (3) FDA and factors that FDA and factors that FDA and USDA has taken to address risks to improve oversight of food safety; and actions taken to improve oversight of food safety; and actions taken to improve oversight of food safety; and actions taken to improve oversight of food safety; and USDA actions to improve oversight of food safety; and whether they are consistent with relevant controls. GAO reviewed relevant regulatory actions taken in response actions taken in response actions taken in response actions taken in response actions taken in response to address these actions taken in response actions taken in response to address risks; and actions taken in response to address identified areas; and actions taken in response to address these actions taken in response actions taken in response actions taken in response actions taken in response; and actions taken in response actions taken in response actions taken in response actions taken taken in response actions taken in']\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(generate_summary(validation_data_txt.select(range(1)), model)[1][0])"],"metadata":{"id":"I1zLt41LcPV6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1650432909559,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":3056,"user":{"displayName":"Jose Talavera","userId":"03337362936427322220"}},"outputId":"ffd840d3-e6d0-4f7f-a89a-20b3bc973604"},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["Input ids are automatically padded from 256 to 1024 to be a multiple of `config.attention_window`: 1024\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["1902"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":25}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import files\n","torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'LED-Legal_GovReport_Short.pth')\n","\n","# download checkpoint file\n","files.download('LED-Legal_GovReport_Short.pth')"],"metadata":{"id":"JgyYRHZUcwok","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":17},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1650432910816,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1265,"user":{"displayName":"Jose Talavera","userId":"03337362936427322220"}},"outputId":"625ff4d4-430a-44e6-b1b0-7dc1943e9c78"},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"],"application/javascript":["\n","    async function download(id, filename, size) {\n","      if (!google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed) {\n","        return;\n","      }\n","      const div = document.createElement('div');\n","      const label = document.createElement('label');\n","      label.textContent = `Downloading \"${filename}\": `;\n","      div.appendChild(label);\n","      const progress = document.createElement('progress');\n","      progress.max = size;\n","      div.appendChild(progress);\n","      document.body.appendChild(div);\n","\n","      const buffers = [];\n","      let downloaded = 0;\n","\n","      const channel = await google.colab.kernel.comms.open(id);\n","      // Send a message to notify the kernel that we're ready.\n","      channel.send({})\n","\n","      for await (const message of channel.messages) {\n","        // Send a message to notify the kernel that we're ready.\n","        channel.send({})\n","        if (message.buffers) {\n","          for (const buffer of message.buffers) {\n","            buffers.push(buffer);\n","            downloaded += buffer.byteLength;\n","            progress.value = downloaded;\n","          }\n","        }\n","      }\n","      const blob = new Blob(buffers, {type: 'application/binary'});\n","      const a = document.createElement('a');\n","      a.href = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob);\n","      a.download = filename;\n","      div.appendChild(a);\n","      a.click();\n","      div.remove();\n","    }\n","  "]},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.Javascript object>"],"application/javascript":["download(\"download_7143c6c5-8dbf-4518-837b-d514ef924191\", \"LED-Legal_GovReport_Short.pth\", 647691313)"]},"metadata":{}}]}]}
